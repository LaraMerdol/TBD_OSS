And this is our branching strategy.\n\n\n  master &gt; whats live in production\n  \n  release &gt; test passed and release point created by CI server\n  \n  dev &gt; daily merges from the development team.\n\n\nIf we consider doing the pull request from release to master stage. \nWhat are the pros and cons to that approach? How can we communicate this with the development team where they want to do PR at dev branch?&#39;, &#39;I don\&#39;t really have an answer, but think the context of the question is worth further discussion.\n\nIf you\&#39;re doing Continuous Deployment, then I\&#39;m not sure of the purpose of the Release branch.   It seems to be duplicating the purpose of either: \n\n\n\&#39;master\&#39;: code being deployed/released   \n\&#39;develop\&#39; integrated feature\nbranches, but not ready release\n\n\nOr, are you using it to group milestones or planned major releases (i.e. Release/1.0, Release/2.0), like a mini-master branch.\nI would not consider this Continuous Delivery (deployment, maybe), but it is certainly a valid pattern if your project requires staged releases rather than Continuous Delivery.\n\nIt\&#39;s also important to also consider your CI setup and how it integrates with your branches. It isn\&#39;t source code that is deployed to Production, but the build artifacts from  your CI system.  Thinking about this might simplify your branching model.\nIf you want to rollback, you don\&#39;t want to rebuild the application from source, you want to re-deploy the pre-built artifacts of the previous version.  Likewise, if you have a build that has passed all your tests and is ready to ship - hopefully is already running on your pre-production environments - you don\&#39;t want to merge it to a different branch, rebuild it and then deploy the new build - you use the build that was tested.\n\nThe next consideration is that every additional branch adds time &amp;amp; complexity for the developers.   Merging, pull requests, waiting for CI to run, etc. are not free so reducing the complexity of the branching strategy to the minimum you require is a good goal. \n\nTo answer your question about where to PR to/from, do you consider &quot;Develop&quot; as the mainline and attempt to keep it stable and working at all times?\nIf so, then the PRs from feature-to-develop are the key integration. Develop is then built, tested, and deployed to your test environments.\nBranching from develop at that point (i.e. to create a Release branch) is then known to be good. \nPromoting that artifact from your test environment to production, without re-building, might remove the need for one of your branches.

But the release cycles are synchronized and periodic. Docker-compose-env project contains the environment definition to start all compatible service versions for development and integration testing purpose.\nCurrent versioning strategy is as follows:\n\nEach commit to master branch is tagged with a semantic version and pushed to docker registry (semantic tags are used to track dependencies during development cycle)\nEach merge commit to persistent release branch is tagged with a release tag and pushed to docker registry (release tags are used to synchronize project versions together for quarterly release)\n\nmaster is the trunk, and periodic release build is initiated by PR from master to release.\n\nI&#39;m skeptical if this the best way to manage versions with microservices based architecture on periodic releases. Any feedback or tips are appreciated. (new)&quot;, &quot;Each of these components must be developed, built, tested, containerized and deployed independently. But the release cycles are synchronized and periodic.\n\nThere is a contradiction here. Microservices mostly solve an organizational problem - the main point is that teams should be able to work independently as much as possible.\nSynchronization between teams is what make them slow. This can happen in different ways, e.g. waiting for another version to be deployed in a shared test environment, or using the same shared database schema, or making releases at the same time.\n\nI&#39;m skeptical if this the best way to manage versions with microservices based architecture on periodic releases.\n\nTry to avoid &amp;quot;synchronized releases&amp;quot;, instead make sure to not break any contracts between the services (e.g. no breaking API changes). Try to release more often, you want to work in small batches to reduce the risk with deployments and changes. Try to not pile of a bunch of changes, deploy continuously - Continuous Delivery. (new)&quot;, &quot;Release cycles are syncronized\nI think the fact that you need to do a synchronized release of all services at the same time could be an indicator that the coupling between your services is higher then it should be and probably the way you are managing it can be improved.\nThe question is how can you design your development teams working on different micro-services so that when they introduce changes and they do not break each others micro-service?\nVersioning and managing changes\nThere are 2 aspects which are important for this to work and they are:\n\nVersioning and how you implement and work with versioning.\nTeam Communication. Communication between teams when introducing breaking changes.\n\nWhat do I mean by this?\nFirst about versioning. Your micro-services are communicating with each other.\nRegardless of the fact that the communication is sync or async using Rest(or SOAP or gRPC or other) or Messaging(Queues) they need to rely on some Contracts. Those Contracts will be some API Contracts(in terms of Java/C# classes/interfaces). They need to be stable as they can be used by other micro-services.\nSuggestion: I would suggest to do versioning of the micro-service independent from the versioning of the Contracts.\nExample:\n\nMicro-service order-micro-service could be at latest version v1.0.0 and Contracts order-micro-service-contracts at version v1.0.0 as well.\nMicro-service customer-micro-service could be at latest version v3.0.0 but Contracts customer-micro-service-contracts could be at version v2.2.1.\nMicro-service product-micro-service could be at latest version v3.0.0 and Contracts product-micro-service-contracts could be at version v4.0.0.\n\nAs you can see from the example above the version from the Micro-service and its corresponding exposed Contracts can be the same but they can also differ. The reason is simply that you can do changes on the micro-service(some internal business logic change) without changing the Contracts. And you can also do changes on the Contracts without changing the micro-service logic. Usually changes happens on both of them in the same time. You update some api business logic for which you adjust the exposed Contract. But sometimes a MAJOR change in the micro-service logic is not necessary a breaking or MAJOR change on the Contracts. As you see this gives you great flexibility. The benefit of this is not only flexibility but also the fact that a micro-service-A will only be dependent on micro-service-B-contracts and not the micro-service-B itself. This is just a suggestion you can also use one version for micro-service and its exposed Contracts.\nNow about team communication. By this I mean if you have an organization where you have multiple teams working on different areas of the system and each team is responsible for one or more micro-services from an particular Domain.\nIf you are using the Semantic versioning like MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH for example v1.3.5 then you can do it in the following way.\nThere are a couple of things which are important to consider:\n\nContracts PATCH/MINOR change\nA change which is a PATCH or MINOR change version upgrade should not be a breaking change and should always be backwards compatible for the consumers who use those contracts. This means that you should ensure that upgrading from version 1.3.0 to 1.4.0 should not be a problem to the consumer regardless of the fact if he upgraded to 1.4.0 or stayed on 1.3.0 for a little longer. Ideally all consumer should update to latest version but even if they don&#39;t for some period they will not be broken by the change. For example a change for which you will do that kind of upgrade would be adding new Contract model or updating existing model with new not mandatory fields, or increasing accepted string length from a field from 20 to 50 or similar.\nContracts MAJOR or breaking change\nIs usually a big change which can also be breaking change. If it is a breaking change then we need some team process in place. The teams who use those contracts need to be notified that the change will happen upfront and even when releasing the new version a bridging period of couple weeks(or sprints) should be ensured where both versions of contracts will work(old and new). This will give the affected teams/micro-services enough time to upgrade and adjust their services. After that the backwards compatibility compromise Contracts/code can be deprecated. Sometimes for some cases a solution for a breaking change Contract change is introducing a complete new version of that Model(class) and not do a hard change on the same Model. For example you could have a CustomerModel class and then introduce CustomerModelV2 and remove the old CustomerModel class after some period. This is a common situation where you have a Contract Model for an Event(Message from a queue) like: CustomerCreated. You can have CustomerCreated and CustomerCreatedV2. You can publish both messages for a particular time period until the consumers adopt and deprecate(stop publishing the event and removing the Contract model) the CustomerCreated event. This depends on your particular business logic or case.\nMicro-service changes\nRegardless of the fact that the change is just a bug fix, small change or a big change in the service if your versioning is separate from the from the Contracts it should not be affecting the other micro-services, at least not from the contract managing prospective. Doing versioning updates on micro-service only gives you the possibility to deploy it independently.\n\nIndependent and separate deployments of micro-services\nIf you apply the above advice&#39;s you will come closer to the situation where you can deploy micro-services independently and without synchronized periods where all services have do be deployed at once.\nOne of the biggest advantages of using micro-services is being able to deploy micro-services independent from other parts of the system so if you have a chance to do that you should go for it.\n\nEach of these components must be developed, built, tested,\ncontainerized and deployed independently. But the release cycles are\nsynchronized and periodic.\n\nSince you already develop, build and tested independently you could also do the release independently.\nI know that all those suggested changes are not only technical but also organizational changes like team communication, team setup and so on. But usually when working with big system using micro-services it a compromise between those 2 worlds and trying to find the best process and solution for your Organization and Business.

I also want to maintain my current Github team account from which I will be looking to make deployments to AWS and have it server as a backup of the main branch.\nMy approach to setting this up will be as follows:\n\nCreate a new GitLab repository and initialize it with a README file.\n\nSet up a branch protection rule for my main branch (either called\n&amp;quot;main&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;master&amp;quot;) to prevent direct pushes to it. I&#39;ll need to set\nup a rule to require code review and at least one approval from a\nteam member before any changes can be merged.\n\nCreate feature branches for new changes or bug fixes. These branches\nshould be short-lived and should only contain the changes required\nfor the specific task.\n\nUse merge requests (MRs) to merge changes from feature branches into\nthe main branch. Each MR should have a description explaining the\nchanges, and it should only include the changes required for the\nspecific feature or bug fix.\n\nUse GitLab&#39;s code review features, such as inline comments and code\nsnippets, to review and discuss changes with team members before\nmerging them into the main branch.\n\nSet up automated testing and continuous integration (CI) using GitLab\nCI/CD to ensure that any changes merged into the main branch are\nautomatically built, tested, and deploys an Apache Mesos cluster on my internal\nhardware.\n\n\nIn parallel to this last step I wish to mirror merges to my main branch to github but to selectively choose when I run Github Actions to deploy to an M3s / Apache mesos cluster to AWS.\nIs this possible and does it abide by a sound trunk based development and CI/ CD methodology ?&quot;, &quot;Sounds ok, though have some thoughts:\n\nCI you mentioned will also be running before merge, right?

(new)&quot;, &#39;Usually, with Continuous Integration, all work done by all developers is done on a single branch (or on trunk). In fact, Subversion was designed with this type of workflow in mind.\nHaving everyone work on the same branch may sound scary. After all, what about collisions? What if I want to include one bug/enhancement/addition, but not another in my next release? \n\nMy experience is that forcing all development to take place on a single branch simply works better. It forces developers to make small, careful changes and to work with each other. The order that issues (bug fixes and enhancements) are handled must be done at the beginning of the development cycle instead of attempting to pick and choose them at the end. Managers like the flexibility of picking and choosing at the end, but it means a massive merge cycle a few days before a release which usually results in rushed testing.\n\nIf you do decide to use private branching, I would recommend that you setup two Jenkins instances. The first will be the official one. You build off of trunk and the release branches, but not developer branches. This Jenkins will do all unit testing. It will store the artifacts required for a release. It will report on the tests. It will be where your QA team will pull releases for testing. Only you are allowed to setup jobs on this Jenkins.\n\nThe other will be for the developers. They can setup a job and run tests on it if they want. It will be for their branches -- the private branches or bug fix branches. \n\nIn answer to your first question: I wouldn\&#39;t bother with running Jenkins on private branches at all. Private branches used to be called sandboxes because developers could play their. The joke was that developers pretty much did in their sandbox what kitty cats did in sandboxes. Enforcing continuous integration on a private branch really takes away the purpose of that branch. You really only care once the code is delivered to trunk.\n\nThat\&#39;s why I recommend two Jenkins setup. The first is for you. It will execute a build whenever a commit/check in happens. The second is for the developers for their private branch. They\&#39;ll setup jobs if they want and execute the build when they want. Its sole purpose is to help developers make sure that everything will work once their code is delivered to the trunk.\n\nDoing it this way completely avoids question #2: You always build after code is delivered to the trunk because that\&#39;s when a commit is done.\n\nThe last one, how code is placed on the server is more of a mystery. I like Jenkins creating a delivery artifact. You can talk about what is released via the Jenkins build number. \n\n&quot;Let\&#39;s release build #25 on the production server.&quot; \n\n&quot;Wait, QA never tested build #25, but they tested build #24.&quot; \n\n&quot;Okay, let\&#39;s release build #24, I see it has issue US232 fixed in it anyway.&quot;\n\nBy the way, we use curl or wget to pull the software off of Jenkins and onto our server. In fact, we have a deploy.sh script we use. You pull the deploy.sh script from Jenkins, and run that. This automatically pulls down the right build from Jenkins and installs it. It shuts down the server, backups up the old install, installs the new software, restarts the server, and then reports back the results.\n\nHowever, there\&#39;s something about the idea of Subversion doing your deliveries for you. Various methods are used. One is that Subversion does an update automatically at a particular time off of a production branch. You put code on the production branch, and at 2:00am every morning, Subversion will deliver your code. It\&#39;s a neat idea, and I\&#39;ve done that -- especially when you\&#39;re talking about PHP which doesn\&#39;t have to be compiled.\n\nI prefer the first method since you have more control and forces you to only deploy Jenkins builds. Plus, there are usually some issue that will cause the svn update method of deployment to fail (collision, unversioned file that needed to be removed, etc.). And of course, this will only happen at the most critical time. And, of course, it will be a spectacular failure that happens right before your boss fills out your annual review.\n\nSo, in response to your third question. My preferred method is not to involve Subversion. Instead, I ftp the built artifacts (using wget and curl) directly off the Jenkins server, and run a true deployment script that handles everything that\&#39;s required.\n\nBy the way, we are looking at various deployment tools like LiveRebel that will integrate with Jenkins. The idea is that Jenkins will build the deliverable package and deploy it to LiveRebel, then IT can use LiveRebel to deploy it to our servers. We aren\&#39;t sure whether each Jenkins build will be deployed to LiveRebel, or we will use the build promotion plugin to let QA select the builds to deploy to LiveRebel. The second will prevent us from deploying builds that QA hasn\&#39;t certified.\n\nADDENDUM\n\n\n  Thanks for the reply and insight. the reason i was looking at per-task branching is for a number of reasons: \n\n\nI\&#39;ll respond to each of your reasons...\n\n\n  1) - allows tasks to be done in isolation from the main trunk. \n\n\nAnd tasks can be done in isolation from each other too. The problem is that the resulting code isn\&#39;t isolated from these tasks and these tasks may be incompatible with each other.\n\nA lot of managers like to think this isolation will allow them to pick and choose which tasks to include in the next release and they\&#39;ll be able to do this at release time. One of the first true CM packages was called Sablime from AT&amp;amp;T and it was based upon this very philosophy.\n\nIn Sablime, you have a Generic which is what they call a release. This is the base for all changes. Each change is assigned a Modification Request (MR Number), and all work must be done upon an MR.\n\nYou create the next generic by taking the old baseline generic, adding in the selected MRs, and tada! A new Generic can be created. Sounds simple: Old baseline + selected changes = new baseline.\n\nUnfortunately, MRs would affect files the same files. In fact, it wasn\&#39;t uncommon for the new generic to contain a version of a file that was not written by an actual developer. Also, one MR ended up depending upon another. A manager would declare that MRs 1001, 1003, and 1005 were in the next release. We try to add these MRs into the baseline, and we find out that MR 1003 is dependent upon MR 1002 which is also dependent upon MR 1008 which is one we don\&#39;t want release. We spend the next week trying to work out a set of releasable MRs and end up releasing software that was never thoroughly tested.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, we ended up with smaller changes between baselines. We would do a new Generic each week, sometimes two of them. This allowed us to make sure merging worked, and made sure that dependent MRs were included first before the MRs that were dependent upon them. However, it also eliminated the entire pick and choose concept. All that was left was a lot of overhead built into Sablime. \n\n\n  2) no time constraints - each task can take its time being completed, and doesnt impact on other tasks.\n\n\nTasks will always impact each other unless they are for two completely different software packages that run on two entirely different machines with two separate databases.\n\nAll tasks have a time constraint because there is a cost associated with time, and a benefit associated with that task. A task which takes a long time, but provides little benefit is not worth doing.\n\nOne of the jobs of development is to prioritize these tasks: Which should be done first, and which should be done later. Tasks that take too long should be broken up into subtasks. \n\nIn Agile development, no task is suppose to take up more resources than the sprint can afford. (A sprint is a mini-release and usually covers a two week period.) In that two week period, a developer has a certain number of points they can fulfill (Points are sort of related to hours, but not really. Just assume that one point represents X hours of work for this thought experiment.) If a developer can do 15 points per week, a task that takes 30 points is too big for the sprint and must be divided up into subtasks.\n\n\n  3) - release and deployments can be done also on a per-task basis, rather than waiting for other tasks to be completed and then do a multi-task release at a fixed point in time (what we are trying to get away from that)\n\n\nNone of what I\&#39;m saying means you can\&#39;t do task based development. Sites that use Git do this a lot. Agile process assumes this.  None of this implies that you go back to the waterfall method where no one is allowed to touch a keyboard until every single excruciating detail has been laid out. However, you can\&#39;t simply do fifty separate tasks and then the day before a release pick and choose which ones you want to include. You don\&#39;t release tasks, you release a software product.\n\nUse task branching. However as far as you are concerned, a task is not complete until its changes are in trunk. Developers are responsible for this. They must rebase (merge the changes from trunk into their branch), test their rebased code and then deliver (merge their changes back to trunk) before the project can consider that task as complete. \n\nThis is why I tell you that you can have two Jenkins instances: One for the official build on trunk and the release branches, and one for developers to do their task building. Developers can have all the fun in the world with their Jenkins and their branches and their development. It just doesn\&#39;t count until it\&#39;s on trunk and you build it with your Jenkins.\n\nThink of Git and how Linux works. There is one official Git repository for Linux. You pull from this repository and that creates your own Git repository on your machine. You can share this Git repository with your friends. You can do what ever your heart desires. You can create another Git repo from  your Git repo, or pull another copy of the official Git repo or find someone else with a Git repo of Linux and pull from there.\n\nHowever, all of the changes you do will not be considered part of Linux until those changes are pushed back to the one and only official Git repository. (new)&#39;, &quot;I would recommend to use Gerrit (https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/). It&#39;s a code review system based on Git. It integrates well with Jenkins (https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Gerrit+Trigger) so that it can trigger a build for each review submitted (that is each commit submitted for merge in trunk gets build by jenkins). The lead developer approves the commit in the UI, and it gets merged into trunk.\n\nI know Git learning curve is steep, but I&#39;ve been using this process for now almost one year and it really improves the process.

I do not understand how the continuous integration with Jenkins works when doing trunk based development. We use git for version control in the organization. \n\nJenkins jobs are setup to poll git for any changes and if any detected to kick in a build and once the build is success start a deploy. \n\nAll developers have access to jenkins and can configure the build to start on a different branch. This code is then deployed in a dev instance for testing. If the developer sees that it is fine they re-configure jenkins build to point back to master. This is manual and it is upto the developer to do this.\n\nThere is a pipeline job which runs periodically and overwrites the Jenkins job with a standard job. So even if a developer leaves screws the configuration, still Jenkins manages to keep the build in a sane state.\n\nNow my questions when working on feature/bugfix branches with more than one commits, what is the best practice for CI/CD process?\n\na) Developer will point to their branch after each of their commit and deploys to dev instance. This as far as I know is manual and developers can easily forget this.\n\nb) Developer will point Jenkins build to their branch before raising a Pull request and deploys to dev instance. If there are multiple commits, the build/deployment could fail because of any of the commits. This is also manual and can be painful for debugging.\n\nc) Developer will run the build locally to make sure tests are passing. Deployment is a dark art and will be left for somebody else to figure out. After the pull request, jenkins will run the build to make sure all tests pass. This is automatic. Now if the build/deployment fails the developer will have figure what went wrong.&#39;, &#39;It sounds like your c) is the right way to go, but I didn\&#39;t fully grasp the situation. For trunk-based development, your CI/Jenkins should only be used before merging, not for each commit (i.e., not as a replacement for the local build mechanism). Your developer should build and test their code locally by running the tests manually and debugging if anything goes wrong.\n\nAt merge time, you can do pre-merge or post-merge build run. For pre-merge, you configure Jenkins to run for each pull-request branch, and if all tests pass, you merge the pull-request. The upside of this is it is pretty simple to configure. The downside is the build doesn\&#39;t take into account of new changes in the trunk branch, so trunk might be broken after a merge, even if the tests passed in the pull-request branch.\n\nFor post-merge, you can checkout a workspace from your trunk branch, do &quot;git merge&quot; from your pull-request branch, and run the build in the workspace. Only if all tests pass, you commit and push the changes to trunk. The upside is it guarantees the trunk won\&#39;t be broken. The downside is that you can only run one build at a time, so it will reduce your merging bandwidth.\n\nYou can also do both pre-merge and post-merge at the same time. The trunk might still be broken from merging, but you can quickly catch it from post-merge builds and fix it immediately.&#39;]</td><td class="s6" dir="ltr">[&#39;Adopt CI/CD pipelines for automated integration and delivery&#39;, &#39;Automate test execution (unit, integration, e2e)&#39;, &#39;Automated build and tests always pass on the CI&#39;, &#39;Enable fast and continuous feedback (+)&#39;, &#39;Promote frequent and rapid integration (CI) (+)&#39;, &#39;Shortens automated feedback cycles by testing each trunk commit against the main codebase through CI/CD pipelines (+).&#39;, &#39;Use a single shared trunk&#39;, &#39;Use short-lived branches&#39;, &#39;Avoid big-bang merges&#39;]</td></tr><tr style="height: 30px"><th id="1569038740R6" style="height: 30px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 30px">7</div></th><td class="s7" dir="ltr">I am getting an error about the XML schema when try to run Android jetpack compose End to End tests to azure pipelines</td><td class="s8" dir="ltr">70890079</td><td class="s9" dir="ltr"><a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70890079/i-am-getting-an-error-about-the-xml-schema-when-try-to-run-android-jetpack-compo">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70890079/i-am-getting-an-error-about-the-xml-schema-when-try-to-run-android-jetpack-compo</a></td><td class="s10" dir="ltr">YANLIŞ</td><td class="s7" dir="ltr">[&#39;I am getting an error about the XML schema when try to run Android jetpack compose End to End tests to azure pipelines (new)&#39;, &quot;I have written many E2E tests for an Android app which is developed with the Jetpack Compose way.

(new)&#39;, &#39;Following Trunk Based Development, shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\nAssume there are two short-lived feature branches(f1 and f2) created from master(trunk). For implementation, source code files used for these branches overlap, in this scenario.\n\nAssume, there is one CI/CD pipeline for master(trunk) that gets triggered on code change.\n\n\n\nOne code conflict that can be possible is functional, f1 could remove or modify existing source code that f2 uses.... This is not a VCS conflict.\n\nDeveloper1 has perform git commit on f1(in laptop) at time t and yet to push\n\nDeveloper2 has perform git commit on f2(in laptop) at time t+24 and yet to push\n\n\n\nAs per my understanding, below is the scenario in commit History file of laptop, before push:\n\n\nGiven above sccenario, f1 can get merge with master, which is a simple fast-forward merge. So, master and f1 will point to 156b4bf commit snapshot, after this merge, as shown below:\n\n\nCI/CD pipeline gets triggered, as merge is successful, with no conflicts\n\nBut when f2 commit happens after 24 hours, Git will perform 3-way merge using 3 snapshots(156b4bf, 96f5b29 and c435356), as shown below:\n\n\nCI/CD pipeline gets triggered again, if merge is successful. My understanding is, Git should block 3-way merge due to functional conflict.\n\n\n\n1) Using Git, Does fast-forward/3-way merge detect functional conflict? \n\n2) If yes, are there any other non-VCS conflict scenarios that ApartCI address? that Git cannot... if yes, how?\n\nNote: No plan to use Gitflow workflow&#39;, &quot;A purely functional conflict is one in which the 2 conflicting changes don&#39;t touch the same files:\n\n\nf1 modifies a function prototype (let&#39;s say in file S1) and all its usages (let&#39;s say in files S2 and S3)\nf2 adds a new function usage in a different file in which the function wasn&#39;t used before (let&#39;s say in file S4), using the original prototype since it doesn&#39;t yet see the f1 change\n\n\nEach change takes in isolation could pass verifications, but when integrated together in the same branch the code won&#39;t work as the invocation added in  S4 won&#39;t match the updated prototype from S1.\n\nIn such case both merges are fast-forward and the conflict can not be detected by git - there will be no actual file merges in the 3-way merge since the changesets don&#39;t touch the same files. Thus neither will the conflict be detected by git-based tools analyzing the merge, for example by gerrit.\n\nOnly the verifications performed by the CI/CD tool can detect such purely functional conflict by finding the mismatch. Depending on the language used it&#39;d be either a build/compilation error or a test/runtime/execution error.\n\nIf the 2 changes cause a merge conflict (3-way or not) it means the conflict is a VCS one, not a purely functional one and yes, it would be detected by git and/or git-based tools, so it would need to be addressed before the merge is allowed (a CI/CD tool execution would not be necessary for detecting it)\n\nTo your 2nd question ApartCI would detect either kind of conflict:\n\n\nif it&#39;s a VCS conflict the 2 changes are overlapping (i.e. they both touch at least one common source file) so they won&#39;t be bundled together for simultaneous verification. Which means that they will never end up in a primary bundle together. One of them will be committed and end up in the project&#39;s baseline first. As soon as that happens the other change will fail patching in its next verification attempt and will be rejected.\nif it&#39;s a purely functional conflict the 2 changes are not overlapping, so they may or may not end up in the same bundle.\n\n\nif they are not in the same bundle the flow of events will be pretty much the same as that for a VCS conflict\nif they are in the same bundle the bundle verification will fail and following the bundle splitting actions they will eventually end up in different bundle and again the same flow of events as that for a VCS conflict will follow (new)&quot;]</td><td class="s11" dir="ltr">[&#39;Adopt CI/CD pipelines for automated integration and delivery&#39;, &#39;Automate test execution (unit, integration, e2e)&#39;, &#39;Automated build and tests always pass on the CI&#39;, &#39;Promote frequent and rapid integration (CI) (+)&#39;, &#39;Reduce merge conflicts (+)&#39;, &#39;Use short-lived branches&#39;, &#39;Use a single shared trunk&#39;]</td></tr><tr style="height: 30px"><th id="1569038740R9" style="height: 30px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 30px">10</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">How to create a Review App in Azure DevOps?</td><td class="s3" dir="ltr">55649886</td><td class="s4" dir="ltr"><a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55649886/how-to-create-a-review-app-in-azure-devops">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55649886/how-to-create-a-review-app-in-azure-devops</a></td><td class="s5" dir="ltr">YANLIŞ</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">[&#39;How to create a Review App in Azure DevOps?

What I would like to add to our CI/CD pipeline is Preview App which can be used as QA step and we could also run our E2E Cypress tests against it.\n\nCurrently our devs have to run E2E tests locally as part of our PR process. For QA step we have to merge the PR to the master so that it will get deployed to our development server. Since QA works against our master branch we are forced to use release branches. After QA approves the merged PR, it&#39;s then cherry-picked to release branch. Release branches are then build and deployed automatically.\n\nI would like to add QA step to our PR process so that we could deploy straight from master.

They are all configured under CC.NET separately so we have a decent amount of control over their build and deployment at present.\n\nWe have developed a CMS system that uses some of the .NET assemblies and includes a common administration website project and a template website example project. Out of this one solution we have the following elements that need to managed separately:\n\n\nAdmin interface is not tied to .NET so it is template based and we are developing a PHP backend for it currently.\nCMS shared assembly build on top of our other common company wide assemblies.\nControl over functionality within each major CMS build/release.\n\n\nI&#39;d like the build output of this solution to be a Visual Studio template, which we can use to develop other client sites and better manage version changes within the CMS itself, as we add features to the codebase.\n\nI have a rough approach for all this and think it is achievable, however, I wanted to open this topic up for discussion and see what everyone else is doing when it comes to managing the build and deployment of multiple solutions.\n\nMain considerations for us are:\n\n\nDo we make use of the integration queue functionality in CC.NET to ensure a build order and pull together the assemblies we need for the CMS at build time?\nDebugging within a CMS client site i.e. stepping into the shared assemblies&#39; code when the client solution is a version of the base CMS system and therefore separate.\nDeveloping and extending the CMS when it uses shared assemblies i.e. do we add the assembly projects to the trunk solution during development (across source control repositories) and then rely on the build to pull it together or do we use a different approach entirely?\nAny other issues people might have experienced that could change our way of thinking?\n\n\nHopefully this question isn&#39;t too vague and some of you will have dealt with these issues. Look forward to hearing everyones experiences.\n\nMany thanks!\nTim (new)&quot;, &quot;I unfortunately cannot answer all of your points, but let me start with this one:\n\n\n  \n  Do we make use of the integration queue functionality in CC.NET to\n  ensure a build order and pull together\n  the assemblies we need for the CMS at\n  build time?\n  \n\n\nThe short answer is -yes, you should. The queue attribute ensures a build order within the running instance of CC.NET and is gives you serialization of the builds that depend on each other. For specifying which projects depend on each other, you should use project triggers. Do not rely on the queuePriority for this task.\n\nYou shold most likely pull the pieces you need to do the build at build time.

Typical reasons for such needs include: \n\n\nsignificantly long time required to verify all release quality criteria, stabilizing the software requires isolating the release from the continued development towards the next release in order to meet those criteria\nmultiple releases need to be maintained at the same time - the release branches become the vehicles for delivering any per-release hot-fixes\n\nif there is no hard requirement for separate release branches releases can become nothing more than tags/labels on the primary development and integration branch - this is really what true CD boils down to. The CI/CD pipeline is executed for every commit and, whenever it passes all release criteria the release is out.\n\n\nYou&#39;d need one Jenkins pipeline for every release branch and one for the primary development branch (if you&#39;re not releasing directly from it).&quot;]</td><td class="s6" dir="ltr">[&#39;Adopt CI/CD pipelines for automated integration and delivery&#39;, &#39;Commit frequently (daily)&#39;, &#39;Use short-lived branches&#39;, &#39;Use a single shared trunk&#39;, &#39;Use temporary release branches&#39;, &#39;Use tags for releases&#39;, &#39;Promote frequent and rapid integration (CI) (+)&#39;, &#39;Shortens automated feedback cycles by testing each trunk commit against the main codebase through CI/CD pipelines (+).&#39;, &#39;Trunk always ready for release&#39;]</td></tr><tr style="height: 30px"><th id="1569038740R14" style="height: 30px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 30px">15</div></th><td class="s7" dir="ltr">Azure Pipelines - How to list Commits and Work Items by Application/Folder using a git mono repo strategy</td><td class="s8" dir="ltr">61531887</td><td class="s9" dir="ltr"><a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61531887/azure-pipelines-how-to-list-commits-and-work-items-by-application-folder-using">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61531887/azure-pipelines-how-to-list-commits-and-work-items-by-application-folder-using</a></td><td class="s10" dir="ltr">YANLIŞ</td><td class="s7" dir="ltr">[&#39;Azure Pipelines - How to list Commits and Work Items by Application/Folder using a git mono repo strategy (new)&#39;, &quot;I recently migrated to a git monorepo strategy where I keep all my APIs and applications, I&#39;m also following trunk-based development using Azure DevOps.\n\nSince each application lives on its own folder in the root of the git repo, I was able to enable branch policies and PR requirements driven by that folder. For example, request PR reviews from the Mobile team to every PR that modifies anything inside the MobileApp/ folder.\n\nLikewise, I was able to configure build and release pipelines to deploy the correct application only when there are changes to its folder to every environment.\n\nNow, I&#39;m having an issue when deploying to environments that require approval.

The other 4 commits belong to different applications and teams.\n\nIs it possible to only show the commits/work items filtering by the folder?

on how you should deploy to multiple AWS accounts by making use of trunk based development (feature/ -&amp;gt; master).\nThe idea of deploying to multiple environments from master was bugging us, because how to determine when and where to deploy to?\nI would love to see some thoughts and ideas on how some of you tackle this.\ne.g. you have 1 master branch, and 3 separate aws accounts for (dev, staging and prod).&#39;, &quot;I&#39;ve thought about this a lot.\nUsing a trunk based development flow where we assume the infra is in alignment with infra-as-code (i.e. code reflects the state of the environment), I&#39;ve found the simplest/clearest method is to have a different directory for each of the environments in combination with modules.\nsome-module v1.2.0\n├── datalake (a component)\n│\xa0\xa0 ├── dev (a terraform working directory) (some resources, also references some-module v1.2.0\n│\xa0\xa0 └── prod (a terraform working directory) (some resources, also references some-module v1.1.0)\n└── networks (a component)\n    ├── dev (a terraform working directory)\n    └── prod (a terraform working directory)\n\nOnce merged, you should auto-apply changes. If you&#39;re worried, implement a check to avoid destroy and recreates but this should always show in your spec plans as part of CI before approval anyway.\nBy having this pattern and using a &amp;quot;what doesn&#39;t work gets reverted&amp;quot; approach. You can ensure that new implementations work in dev before you copy them to prod.\nSome common alternative views would be:\n\nsplitting via a ../common directory:\n\nPro: Good for avoiding drift\nCon: Terrible for rapid iteration in dev.\n\n\nSplitting via TFvars:\n\nPro: Simple and consistent environments are identical except for a few values (inputs not resources), similar to common modules dir.\nCon: Doesn&#39;t allow for drift (of resources) without affecting all environments.&quot;]</td><td class="s11" dir="ltr">[&#39;Adopt CI/CD pipelines for automated integration and delivery&#39;, &#39;Use a single shared trunk&#39;, &#39;Promote frequent and rapid integration (CI) (+)&#39;, &#39;Simplifies the development workflow (+)&#39;, &#39;Trunk always ready for release&#39;, &#39;Deploy frequently and provide fast feedback&#39;, &#39;Enable fast and continuous feedback (+)&#39;, &#39;Auto-apply infrastructure changes to environments after merging to trunk (new)&#39;]</td></tr><tr style="height: 30px"><th id="1569038740R19" style="height: 30px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 30px">20</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Adding linting to autotools-based build system</td><td class="s3" dir="ltr">29811970</td><td class="s4" dir="ltr"><a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29811970/adding-linting-to-autotools-based-build-system">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29811970/adding-linting-to-autotools-based-build-system</a></td><td class="s5" dir="ltr">YANLIŞ</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">[&#39;Adding linting to autotools-based build system (new)&#39;, &#39;I want to add cpplint.py (https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cpplint/cpplint.py) to an autotools-based project.

But merging the branch back into the trunk is having its way with me:\n\n4) After all updates committed in branch-b2; I make sure I do an SVN Update on trunk and branch-b2.\n\n5) Then, I try to merge (range of revisions) from branch-b2 into the trunk.  However, for any new file that had been added to the trunk, and subsequently added to branch-b2 when I rebased it, I get a tree-conflict.  I&#39;m not sure what the proper way is to resolve these conflicts.\n\nThe most typical advice I&#39;ve seen is to either delete the tree-conflict files from the trunk, then merge the branch over; or delete the entire trunk, copy the branch files over, and then commit them as a new version in the trunk.  Neither of those options seems like a good idea- first one is a pain, and both seem like they would lose file revision histories.\n\nWhat&#39;d I do wrong, and how do I fix it? (new)&quot;, &#39;Sounds like you\&#39;re using the pre-1.5 merge style and trying to reintegrate the branch into trunk. In that case, what you want to do is first ensure all the trunk changes have been merged in to the branch, and then instead of range-merging the branch to a working copy that points to the trunk, you want to merge &quot;FROM trunk@HEAD TO branch@HEAD&quot; with the working copy pointing to trunk. In essence:\n\n&quot;Give me all the changes I\&#39;d need to make trunk identical to branch&quot;.\n\nThis works if you\&#39;ve already merged all the trunk changes to the branch, because then the only difference between trunk and branch are the changes made in the branch.\n\nMake sense? :) (new)&#39;, &#39;I investigated the same problem.\nIt is &quot;feature&quot; in Tortoise SVN 1.6.5.\nTortoiseSVN 1.5 works fine with our repositoty (SVN 1.5).\nTortoiseSVN 1.6.5 when rebasing adds files from mainline as NEW (without saving merge-history).\nAnd reintegrating branch resuls in treating those files as conflicting with mainline.\n\nI solved the problem by using feature of TortoiseSVN 1.6 &quot;reintegrate branch&quot;. It\&#39;s specifically purposed for feature-branches.\n\n--\nAlexey Korsun (new)&#39;, &#39;Here\&#39;s a little more info to contribute to @Rytmis answer that helps me keep this straight.\n\nHigh-level steps of making the trunk exactly like a branch or tag:\n\n\nCheckout from the trunk.\nUsing working copy of trunk, merge from trunk to branch/tag.\nCommit.\n\n\nExample \&#39;svn\&#39; command line commands:\n\nsvn checkout &amp;lt;trunk url&amp;gt;\ncd trunk\nsvn merge &amp;lt;trunk url&amp;gt; &amp;lt;branch/tag url&amp;gt;\nsvn commit -m &quot;&amp;lt;message&amp;gt;&quot; (new)&#39;, &#39;I could not really figure out how the above solution was to work so my work around is different. First I made sure the branch contained all the changes from the trunk.\n\n1)I got a fresh copy of the trunk. 2)I exported the branch to a temporary location using the tortoise svn export. 3)I used windows explorer to copy the entire branch tree over to the trunk and overwrote all files 4)I used the check for changes command on tortoise and included all unrevisioned files checkbox. 5)I selected all the files and clicked add.\n\nYou should use solutions that have not been built so the unrevisioned files do not include output.\n\nI cant wait until we upgrade to 1.5+ (new)&#39;, &#39;Select revisions to Merge while selecting &quot;Merge a range of rivisions&quot; option using TortoiseSVN.

I have done a quick google and the possible reasons for slow merges seem to include any and all of the following: -\n\n\nLarge repo size (both in terms of size on disk and number of revisions).\nLarge source tree (apparently SVN has to crawl down the tree in order to work out changes)\nThe version of SVN server / client\nVery large (several MB) files (we don\&#39;t have very large single files so I doubt this affect us)\n\n\nI guess I really want to know how to find out which of the above points are making merges so slow.    \n\nRight now I am in the dark as to whether it is work on the client or work on the server that is taking the most time (well I suspect it is the client since CPU usage is not massive on the server).  I did think that it might be the vast amount of mergeinfo that has accumulated over 100s of merges but I have done a test where I have deleted all the merge info from a couple of branch and then did a merge and found the same slowness.\n\nSo what I would like to ask is: -\n* How would one go about diagnosing/profiling the SVN activity?\n* Based on the info below, is there something really obvious that will be causing the poor performance?\n\nThanks\n\nChris\n\nHere are some facts / figures about our SVN setup\n\n\nOur SVN repository has around 32000 revisions.\nRepo size on disk: 8.3GB\nOur development branches each have around 1400 versioned folders (19,000 versioned files)\nSVN Server: 1.6.6 (r40053) (hosted in Apache running on Ubunto Lucid Lynx)\nI am using tortoise 1.6.9 on Win7 (although other members of the team use SmartSVN and they report the same sort of speed).\n\n\nEdit\n\nIt might be worth adding that when we branch / merge, we branch from trunk and always merge the entire branch back into trunk.  So all the mergeinfo is on the trunk (and branches) folder.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn my case, it appeared to be the disk access that was the bottleneck in the merge process - when I moved my source tree from my HDD to my SSD, the same merge went from 50 +/- 5s to 7 +/- 1s.\nWatching the tortoise SVN process in process explorer during the merge was quite telling: whilst doing a merge on my HDD the I/O bytes was between 500kb/s and 3Mb/s for most of the duration.  On the SSD the I/O bytes was up to 10-20Mb/s.   [Rather confusingly, some merges on my HDD were of comparable speed (and I/O bytes were similarly high) as those on my SSD - in these cases, I assume that a lot of the files being read were already in the windows file cache].\n\nI found the following all increased merge speed\n\n\nMerging from &amp;amp; to a folder deeper down the source hierarchy: this is not really an option for us to in &quot;real-life&quot; because merge tracking becomes almost impossible if not recorded at the &quot;trunk-level&quot; folder but does show that merging much smaller trees makes the process much faster.\nReducing the size of the working set being merged to helps (provided that you use the &quot;working set&quot; depth merge option and not the fully recursive) - so by simply deleting the folders (from my working set under trunk) increased speed. (new)&#39;, &#39;you can also try merge in a shorter tree to find if it returns quicker to see if the smaller tree makes a difference.\n\nNote: There has been a lot of merge related improvements in the latest version check the below link\n\nhttp://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/tags/1.6.11/CHANGES\n\nUpgrading to latest might help. (new)&#39;, &quot;One thing I&#39;ve noticed while merging is that merges that use top level directory are very fast. So that merging a feature branch back to trunk or merging a range of revision from trunk to your feature branch is fast. But merging changes from a specific file somewhere in the working copy is extremely slow. For this reason I always branch the entire trunk and then change whatever files I need to, then merge the entire thing. So if your branch was created from one trunk&#39;s subdirectory this might be why it&#39;s very slow. (new)&quot;, &#39;Another factor is the relative delta between the two branches. So for example, if you branch off of trunk and then merge trunk into the branch a month later, this will take a long time, relatively speaking. On the other hand, if you merge from trunk into your branch every day, this will be relatively fast.

The workflow for developers is essentially:\n\nCreate a feature branch (for new features / bug-fixes / etc)\nPull request once work is complete and ready for review\nAfter review and approval, squash and merge into trunk branch\nRepeat\n\nMy question is: How do we correctly create a release branch with this workflow?\nFrom the previous release branch?\nFrom a specific commit?\nFrom nothing (orphan branch)?\n\nThoughts\nThroughout development we cherry-pick commits into a release branch (for QA, demo use, customer feedback, etc). This process is working well because it minimizes the burden on the development team, and we know exactly what features make it into a release. It has improved our pipeline, because the team has no need to engage in development freezes and/or be concerned with merging into the correct (release/hotfix) branch.\nA potential downside is release branches that are divergent from the trunk, but that has not been a concern for us so far. In principle, every commit that ever makes it into trunk makes it into a release branch, current or future.\nSo far we&#39;ve been making due by choosing a commit in trunk that contains no commits meant for the next release, and usually none or few commits for the current release, then we cherry-pick everything relevant into the release branch. That seems clumsy and I have concerns.\nDoes it make sense to create a release branch from the previous release branch, and then cherry-pick from trunk at that point? I don&#39;t see a downside considering the branch is already divergent. We never intend on deleting the release branches, because they are effectively our tagged releases. It&#39;s logical in the sense that each release is based on the previous release, but we&#39;re not confident we&#39;re not creating future problems.&quot;]</td><td class="s11" dir="ltr">[&#39;Cherry-pick changes to release branches&#39;, &#39;Squashing commits into logical units&#39;, &#39;Use short-lived branches&#39;, &#39;Avoid development freezes with cherry-picking&#39;, &#39;Use a single shared trunk&#39;]</td></tr><tr style="height: 30px"><th id="1569038740R27" style="height: 30px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 30px">28</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Strategy to git revert a set of commits on a feature branch, then prepare for another PR to revert the revert</td><td class="s3" dir="ltr">62335155</td><td class="s4" dir="ltr"><a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62335155/strategy-to-git-revert-a-set-of-commits-on-a-feature-branch-then-prepare-for-an">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62335155/strategy-to-git-revert-a-set-of-commits-on-a-feature-branch-then-prepare-for-an</a></td><td class="s5" dir="ltr">YANLIŞ</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">[&#39;Strategy to git revert a set of commits on a feature branch, then prepare for another PR to revert the revert (new)&#39;, &#39;Just so it\&#39;s clear, I\&#39;ve seen &quot;git revert&quot;, and I don\&#39;t believe it helps me.  I\&#39;ll explain what I want and why &quot;git revert&quot; doesn\&#39;t help.\n\nI created a PR (one in each of two repositories, in fact) for some experimental changes that need to be merged to master and deployed to our test server. It\&#39;s not practical to deploy the PR to the test server.  Those PRs have now been merged.  We will be doing some testing of those changes over the next few days.\n\nHowever, these experimental changes should not go into a release.  After I merged the PRs, I discovered that the next release branch is being cut from master this evening or tomorrow morning.  I will have time to revert the changes in the release branch after it is cut, but I definitely will have to do that, if I don\&#39;t revert the changes before the branch is cut.\n\nWe use trunk-based development, and all changes go into PRs which are then merged to master and then the commits of those PRs are cherry picked to the release branch (for changes destined for the release branch that are made after the release branch is cut).  We create a feature branch off of the release branch, cherry pick into that, and then merge that to the release branch.\n\nWhether I revert the changes before or after the release branch is cut, I will have to construct a feature branch with the specific changes reverted.  Fortunately the number of changes are small, so I could do this manually if I had to.  I would have liked to use &quot;git revert&quot;, but from what I understand, I would have to use &quot;git revert&quot; when I have the master branch checked out.  That would put the commits in the master branch of my local repository, which I can\&#39;t push the remote, as it\&#39;s not in a feature branch.\n\nI would really like &quot;git revert&quot; to create the commits reverting the specific commits on the master branch, but put them into a feature branch that I designate.  I don\&#39;t believe it can do that.\n\nIs there some way I can use &quot;git revert&quot; on the local master branch, but then move those commits to a feature branch?\n\nOnce I get these changes reverted, I will then have to create another PR that reverts the reverted commits, getting back to the experimental changes I need to test.\n\nHow can I manage this process properly using git, instead of making these changes manually?&#39;, &quot;I&#39;m not sure I follow accurately as you are using many branches to explain the problem. If I understood you right, you created a feature branch, it&#39;s already merged to master. You would like to create a different PR to revert those changes? You can start a branch from master and ask to revert all the revisions that made up the original PR without any problem....then merge to master your new PR and the original PR is gone.... well, the content, because the original revisions will stay in master.\n\nIf that is what you want, I would do it a little less cumbersome without the reverts.\n\ngit checkout revision-from-master-where-first-pr-started\ngit reset --soft first-pr-branch\n# at this point all changes required to revert the first PR are in index\ngit commit -m &#39;reverting feature X&#39;\n# created a single revision to revert everything\ngit rebase --onto master HEAD~ HEAD # moved that revision to the tip of master\ngit checkout -b feature-reversal\n# the reversal is in the branch you just created, a single revision (new)&quot;]</td><td class="s6" dir="ltr">[&#39;Cherry-pick changes to release branches&#39;, &#39;Use a single shared trunk&#39;, &#39;Use short-lived branches&#39;, &#39;Support safe experimentation and rollback&#39;, &#39;Use temporary release branches&#39;]</td></tr><tr style="height: 30px"><th id="1569038740R28" style="height: 30px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 30px">29</div></th><td class="s7" dir="ltr">Tortoise SVN: How to synchronize branch with trunk after merging bugfix from branch into trunk</td><td class="s8" dir="ltr">45964045</td><td class="s9" dir="ltr"><a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45964045/tortoise-svn-how-to-synchronize-branch-with-trunk-after-merging-bugfix-from-bra">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45964045/tortoise-svn-how-to-synchronize-branch-with-trunk-after-merging-bugfix-from-bra</a></td><td class="s10" dir="ltr">YANLIŞ</td><td class="s7" dir="ltr">[&#39;Tortoise SVN: How to synchronize branch with trunk after merging bugfix from branch into trunk (new)&#39;, &#39;I recreated my issue in a new empty SVN repository:\n\nRevision 1:\n\n\n/trunk/\n/branches/\n\n\nOperation: add text file &quot;init.txt&quot; to branch &quot;trunk&quot;\n\nRevision 2:\n\n\n/trunk/init.txt\n/branches/\n\n\nOperation: create feature branch based on trunk\n\nRevision 3:\n\n\n/trunk/init.txt\n/branches/featureA/init.txt\n\n\nOperation: add unstable feature to branch\n\nRevision 4:\n\n\n/trunk/init.txt\n/branches/featureA/init.txt\n/branches/featureA/unstable.txt\n\n\nOperation: fix bug in feature branch by adding file &quot;bugfix.conf&quot;\n\nRevision 5:\n\n\n/trunk/init.txt\n/branches/featureA/init.txt\n/branches/featureA/unstable.txt\n/branches/featureA/bugfix.conf\n\n\nOperation: merge &quot;bugfix.conf&quot; back into trunk but skip &quot;unstable.txt&quot;\n\nScreenshot of first merge dialog page\n\nScreenshot of second merge dialog page\n\nRevision 6:\n\n\n/trunk/   [svn:mergeinfo=/branches/featureA:3,5]\n/trunk/init.txt\n/trunk/bugfix.conf\n/branches/   [no svn:mergeinfo]\n/branches/featureA/init.txt\n/branches/featureA/unstable.txt\n/branches/featureA/bugfix.conf\n\n\nOperation: continue working at file &quot;init.txt&quot; trunk\n\nRevision 7:\n\n\n/trunk/   [svn:mergeinfo=/branches/featureA:3,5]\n/trunk/init.txt  (new content)\n/trunk/bugfix.conf\n/branches/   [no svn:mergeinfo]\n/branches/featureA/init.txt  (old content)\n/branches/featureA/unstable.txt\n/branches/featureA/bugfix.conf\n\n\nOperation: try to synchronize the feature branch with the trunk\n\nExpected outcome:\nRevision 8:\n\n\n/trunk/   [svn:mergeinfo=/branches/featureA:4]\n/trunk/init.txt  (new content)\n/trunk/bugfix.conf\n/branches/   [svn:mergeinfo=/trunk:6]\n/branches/featureA/init.txt  (new content)\n/branches/featureA/bugfix.conf\n\n\nFirst attempt\n\nOn feature branch choose &quot;Merge a range of revisions -&gt; all revisions&quot;\n\nError: &quot;Reintegrate can only be used if revisions 3 through 7 were previously merged from /branches/featureA to the reintegrate source, but this is not the case: trunk Missing ranges /branches/featureA:4&quot;\n\nWhy does SVN need revision 4 to also be merged?

(at the moment we are using trunk-based development, but without release candidate, which is not sufficient anymore)\nThere is nice description on google: https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-trunk-based-development\n\nThe challenge we have is how to merge bugfix into several Release branches.\nImagine this situation:\n\nYou create Release 1 (similar to 1.0.0 in picture)\nYou do several changes to Trunk\nYou publish Release 1 to Production\nYou create Release 2 (similar 1.1.0 in picture)\nYou do several changes to Trunk\n\nNow you find out that there is critical bug in Release 1:\n\nYou create bugfix from latest commit in Release 1\nYou merge it back to Release 1 (thus creating 1.1) and then you merge Release 1.1 to Trunk\nYou happily publish Release 1.1 to Production\n\nSo far all of the above is complient with the picture from Google.\nHowever now is the question how to get the same bugfix to Release 2. (it does not matter if Release 2 is on production or not). You cannot just merge Trunk to Release 2 - some untested changes were made. So the recommended approach is to cherry-pick bugfix from trunk and merge it to Release 2. Altough that would work, it looks a bit human error-prone (not picking everything or not doing it correctly + the visibility of what is merged in history is also not easy to see).\nI would personally merge directly the Hotfix branch (that originated from Release 1) to Release 2 (therefore creating Relase 2.1 with bugfix). However all references about trunk-based development with release branches are mentioning cherry picking from Trunk and not merging the bugfix directly.\nAm I missing something? Why is cherry picking better/more used solution than just merging the bugfix?&#39;, &quot;This is the mistake, in my opinion:\n\nNow you find out that there is critical bug in Release 1:\n\nYou create bugfix from latest commit in Release 1\n\n\nPeople do this for expediency, but the &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; method is to create the bug fix as a new branch, whose parent commit is the commit in which the bug was introduced.\nThat is:\n                    tag:v1\n                       |\n                    I--J   &amp;lt;-- release-oriented-items-for-v1\n                   /\n...--B--C---------G--H   &amp;lt;-- mainline\n         \\       /\n          D--E--F   [feature, originally]\n\nNow suppose the actual bug was introduced in commit E, during the implementation of the feature.\nThe &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; way to fix this is not to add fixes at (after) H and J but rather to add it immediately after commit E, like this:\n                    tag:v1\n                       |\n                    I--J   &amp;lt;-- release-oriented-items-for-v1\n                   /\n...--B--C---------G--H   &amp;lt;-- mainline\n         \\       /\n          D--E--F   [feature, originally]\n              \\\n               K   &amp;lt;-- fix1234\n\nBranch fix1234 (i.e., commit K) can now be easily merged into every downstream release—well, as easily as any development since E makes it, anyway.\n(Read the next two paragraphs in parallel, and merge them in your head.)\nNote that if—as does occur in practice—it&#39;s necessary to make the initial hotfix as a follow-on commit to J, we can still cherry-pick that fix back (so that it comes just after E) to form the fix1234 branch, which we can then forward-merge into every release (including the v1 release branch, if only to show that yes, the fix is now included in future v1-based releases).  And, if the bug no longer appears, you can choose to merge with -s ours, or not bother to merge at all, based on how you feel about using the &amp;quot;merge indicates bug is fixed&amp;quot; idea.\nSee also Raymond Chen&#39;s series of blog posts describing this same idea.  Note that this general plan, &amp;quot;go back in time and fix the bug and then merge the fix forward in time&amp;quot;, works for all the bug cases, and doing the &amp;quot;cherry-pick back in time so that we can merge forward&amp;quot; technique works in all the bug cases.  The fix need only be merged in any commit that is a descendant of the bug, and does need to be merged in every release that is a descendant of the bug, and the fact that it is or is not merged tells you whether the bug is or is not fixed. (new)&quot;, &quot;If I were using this strategy, I would do what you suggest: I would either merge the hotfix branch from release1 into release2, or perhaps even just merge release1 into release2 after it&#39;s done. From there you only have to do one merge of release2 back into trunk, rather than two, and the additional cherry-picks wouldn&#39;t be needed. In general, I always prefer merging when possible, and resorting to cherry-picking only when necessary. IMHO having duplicate similar commits in the repo history should be avoided whenever possible, because it adds unnecessary complexity and oftentimes causes additional merge conflicts to deal with. (Which are easy to resolve, but they do take some measurable amount of extra time.)\nI can think of 2 scenarios where cherry-picks might be helpful:\n\nIf the bug fix went into trunk before someone realized it also needed to go into release1, then cherry-picking the fix commit(s) into release would make sense (either via a hotfix branch or directly). At this point you&#39;ll still have 2 similar copies of the commit(s) in the repo but there isn&#39;t much you can do about that. From there though, I would still merge release1 back down into release2 instead of also cherry-picking the fixes into release2, which would just create an unnecessary third copy of the commits.\nIn the case where you are supporting multiple releases in Production, and not all hotfixes are merged back into trunk, then cherry-picking fixes into some release branches, and perhaps trunk would make sense. I don&#39;t think this is your scenario, or even the scenario that this branching strategy is designed for.\n\nSide note that is almost a joke: I can think of a (somewhat pessimistic) 3rd reason that cherry-picking might be suggested here too. If you do branch merges as you and I are suggesting here, then this branching strategy is pretty much the same thing as Git Flow, except without the extra 3rd branch called master or main to act as a placeholder for &amp;quot;the current commit that is in Production&amp;quot;. A lot of people (and companies) like to create their own branching strategies, and many of them inevitably use Git Flow as a comparison and need a way to differentiate themselves from it. In Git Flow the main branch is conceptionally optional if you don&#39;t want to point it to the Production commit and remember it another way for hotfixes (like you&#39;re doing). After that, the only obvious way this strategy differs from Git Flow is by suggesting cherry-picking instead of merging.

When a developer thinks that the feature is ready, our SVN maintainer merges the code into the stable branch, which then gets regularly built and deployed on our test servers. \nWe have also some feature branches but they generally are not a problem because they get reintegrated into the trunk only at the very end of the feature development.\n\nThe main problem is the trunk. It has a high chance to become chaotic because of daily commits. No-one can guarantee that at the end of day every developer will have a code that does not break something for other developers. You could say - if it does not work then don\&#39;t commit it, but then we risk to lose a day of work in case of PC or hard drive failures. We could create a separate branch for each developer but managing and merging those branches is not a trivial process on SVN, especially because some developers are beginners (we take some trainees from our local university). And some features have just a day or two of development time, so it is not worth the hassle to create a dedicated branch on SVN.\n\nWhen looking for tools to simplify our workflow, I remembered my experience with TFS shelvesets. They seemed really useful for storing unfinished changes on the remote server. But shelvesets do not support versioning, which might be a problem if a developer needs to revert to some earlier code. Also moving to TFS is not an option for us because our servers are Linux based, although our developers are mainly using Windows with Visual Studio.\n\nThen I started exploring Git. It seems really powerful, and also there are some extensions for Visual Studio emerging lately. But I\&#39;m a bit confused about how it will work out. It seems that Git offers local clones of repository which is nice, but still we need to push the local changes to the central server quite often to avoid data loss. \n\nWhat we essentially need, is ability for developers to &quot;automagically&quot; work on their own branch (fully featured, with versioning etc.) which is stored on the central server to avoid data loss in case some developer\&#39;s PC fails. Each developer gets his own branch by default (and he/she should be able to fork a branch off his/her &quot;master&quot; branch for some experiments), but developers should not be permitted to push changes from their branches directly into the Git master branch. Only the person responsible for maintaining the master branch will be allowed to merge-in the features from developer &quot;master&quot; branches.\n\nWill it be possible to achieve such workflow with Git by default or do we need some additional tools or settings?\nCould Git offer a better workflow which essentially lets us achieve the same goal - minimize risk of data loss caused by working on detached local copies and minimize chaos caused by pushing daily changes to our central repository? (new)&#39;, &#39;Preface\n\nBad workflow (and poor usage of current SCM) is bad reason for changing SCM\n\nFace\n\nYes, Git can (theoretically) help minimize risk of data losses and risk of chaos\n\n\nEach developer have local repository and at least two remotes: personal remote repo and common Central repo\nBecause each developer work in own repo, he can\&#39;t destroy other\&#39;s work\n\n\nBut Git, due to\n\n\nDVCS nature\noverall complexity\n\n\nbring a lot of additional headaches:\n\n\nmanaging ACLs for branches in &quot;central&quot; repo is big heavy not-obvious task\nDVCS means you can\&#39;t effectively manage every repository (and Information Security)\n&quot;Beginners&quot;, which have problems with ordinary daily-usage of Subversion, will have a lot more troubles with Git\nGit in Windows is still &quot;pour cousin&quot; with a heap of platform-specific issues and problems\n\n\nResume\n\nI\&#39;ll suggest streamline your workflow, fix (bad) habits and continue to work in Subversion at least some time.\n\nI.e\n\n\nStart using &quot;Branch per Task&quot; workflow, don\&#39;t commit into trunk directly - trunk must (ideally) contain only mergesets\nFollow strictly main VCS-rule &quot;Commit often, commit fast&quot; - one giant commit per day is terrible idea.

(new)&#39;, &quot;I know svn diff, but it only gives the difference between my working copy and the current revision that I last checked out from the repository.\n\nI want the difference between my working copy today and my working copy yesterday. (Maybe like a &#39;Track Changes&#39; in MS Word.)\n\nI am working on a large code base, thousands of files and folders, thousands of lines per file. I currently do code compilation on Ubuntu VM, and keeping track of different versions of each file via multiple different copies in a Windows folder. Then I also have another Windows folder working copy for SVN commits. I also have another Ubuntu directory working copy for SVN commits in case I want to commit from Linux. This gets quite confusing. Hoping for a good solution.\n\nUpdate 1:\n\nI recently created a local SVN server on my Ubuntu VM that could take care of the changes that I make. But I faced the problem of how to transfer the updated company server source codes to my local server and vice versa. \n\nSo this doesn&#39;t work out.\n\nUpdate 2:\n\nI managed to create a branch from the trunk of the repository on the company server. (Thanks to advice from Robert Levy.)\n\nI transferred all my changes to this branch using diff and patch commands on Ubuntu.\n\nBy this time I have lots of changes done to the source codes for testing only, so I would not merge these changes to the trunk.\n\nHowever I would be making subsequent changes that I wish to merge into the trunk.\n\nI am expecting some conflicts because the new change (that I want to merge) would be one line before the previous change (that I don&#39;t want to merge) so the diff would not be clean.\n\nIs it a good idea to create yet another branch for the purpose of merging? What are the steps or potential conflict resolutions?\n\nUpdate 3:\n\nI am getting used to merging trunk and branches with Tortoise SVN, hopefully.\n\n(Should I compile on branch &#39;to_test&#39; or branch &#39;to_merge&#39; or trunk?) One step at a time.\n\nUpdate 4:\n\nI now edit and cross-compile the toolchain on branch &#39;to_test&#39; in Ubuntu. Now and then, I merge the trunk to branch &#39;to_merge&#39;, and merge the trunk to branch &#39;to_test&#39; (resolving any conflicts). When my feature is complete, I would merge selected changes from branch &#39;to_test&#39; to branch &#39;to_merge&#39; then merge all from branch &#39;to_merge&#39; to the trunk. All the merging is done in TortoiseSVN and KDiff3 on Windows so it is pretty convenient.\n\nThis is certainly a great leap forward from manually making multiple backup copies of individual files.\n\nThanks, Stack Exchange.\n\nUpdate 5:\n\nI now have two branches: &#39;Understanding&#39; and &#39;Development&#39;. In the &#39;Understanding&#39; branch, I can litter it with lots of printk debugging statements. In the &#39;Development&#39; branch, I make only the changes necessary for the required feature. Once the feature is complete, I would merge all from the &#39;Development&#39; branch to the trunk. My company uses the &#39;stable trunk&#39; policy. The &#39;trunk&#39; should be ready for production.\n\nIn the &#39;Understanding&#39; branch, I committed all my past manual changes at one shot after using a diff patch. So it would be impossible to select individual changes for merging. Therefore, my &#39;Understanding&#39; branch and &#39;Development&#39; branch are independent from each other. (new)&quot;, &quot;Create a branch for yourself.  This will be your own private branch where you can feel free to commit changes regularly without fear of impacting anybody else.  By committing frequently, you can easily pull up diffs showing what changed in a given day.  When you are ready, merge your private branch back up to the main branch so that others can benefit from the awesome work you&#39;ve done. (new)&quot;, &#39;The other way of working is to have a git or mercurial repository locally that shadows the svn repository, you can make frequent commits to the local repository and you can use a pull, rebase, merge, commit, push cycle to commit your changes to the svn repository.\n\nThe only caveat is that changes committed to your local repository only exist there until you have done a push.  You can however have another directory that is a clone of the hg/git repository that is on another machine on the local network or on a removable drive that if you cd to it and then pull it will backup your changes, in full, remarkably quickly.\n\nTo set this up with mercurial the process would be something like:\n\nhg clone svn+https://Path/To/Your/SVN/Repo ~/HG_Working\ncd /media/me/removable/drive \nhg clone ~/HG_Working\n\n\nOnce you have made some changes in ~/HG_Working:\n\n~/HG_Working&amp;gt; hg commit -m &quot;Tuesdays Work&quot;\ncd /media/me/removable/drive \nhg pull\nhg up (new)&#39;, &quot;you can create a git repository  on github or bitbucket\n\nthat is free for use.  you can create  git branch in your local system. then can push all update form local to Remote.  if you don&#39;t want to keep your code on remote then you can init git in local then just copy  .git folder form one to another location for safety.   \n\nthere may type of command available for track your code or status.

Feature management:\nAs Continuation integration says we need to commit our changes to the main branch at least once a day so how to manage incomplete feature branches and what are the best practices?\xa0\nI&#39;m aware of the feature toggle/flag concept, but Is there any other option than the feature toggle?\n2. Release management:\nHow to create Release branches only with the complete feature if the main branch also contains incomplete features?\nThanks.&quot;, &quot;You are correct that CI is about merging your branches to your mainline branch at least once a day. Jez Humble created a slightly jokey certification process for CI. You just need to be able to answer yes to 3 questions.\n\nDo all developers merge their code to the mainline branch at least once a day?\nDo you have a process for validating that the merge hasn&#39;t broken anything? (build and test)\nIf the merge has broken something, is it fixed or reverted within 10 minutes?\n\nIf you can answer yes to all 3 questions then you are doing CI. If you can&#39;t answer yes to all 3 then you&#39;re doing something, but it isn&#39;t CI. Unfortunately tooling vendors have muddied the waters by calling build tools &amp;quot;CI Tools&amp;quot; so a lot of folks think that if they have an automated build then they are doing CI. But that&#39;s only relevant to question 2\nIn addition CD says that your mainline branch should always be releasable. So you should be able to push the code in the mainline to prod at any time, and not worry about it.\n\nThis philosophy of keeping the mainline in an always-releasable state is the central tenet of Continuous Delivery.\nhttps://martinfowler.com/articles/branching-patterns.html#release-ready-mainline\n\nWhich leads us to your question.\nThe short answer is, you don&#39;t use branches to manage feature availability or release management. You use feature toggles! It&#39;s a big subject but there are 2 obvious things to focus on.\n\nDo you have sufficient test automation to answer question 2 above. I.e if your build passes, are you confident that the code &amp;quot;works&amp;quot;\nFeature flags / toggles.\n\nThere are different types of Feature Toggle and you&#39;re need seems to be release toggles. This is a technique where you hide features behind a toggle so that they can be active or dormant depending on the environment.\nThat way you can have code paths that are only available in development / test environments but that functionality is hidden from the users in production. Once the development of the feature is complete then you can flip the toggle in production and users can now see the new feature.\nEssentially what you&#39;re trying to do is decouple Deployments and Releases. Where a Deployment is &amp;quot;installing and configuring software&amp;quot; and a Release is &amp;quot;Making new functionality available to customers, including potentially spending a bunch of money of Marketing&amp;quot;\nIn very very basic terms you&#39;re sticking your new feature behind an &amp;quot;if&amp;quot; statement and pulling in a value of true or false from an external datastore of some kind which can be updated without the need for a deployment. For release toggles, these if statements tend to be transitory, so once the feature is released you need to go and clean up the code.\nOther types of toggle might be longer lived. you might have a toggle thats based on &amp;quot;is the customer paying me extra money&amp;quot; in which case that toggle will exist until the feature is retired or becomes part of the base product.\nThere are some tools which can help with Feature toggles.

(new)&#39;, &quot;My team&#39;s development processes are based on continuous integration. The only branches we create are maintenance branches when we release, but otherwise developers are expected to commit regularly (daily if not more often) to trunk, so that everyone&#39;s work is always integrated, continually tested, and all that good stuff.\n\nMy understanding of DVCS is that it is great for branching. I worked some years ago in a team where this would have been very useful, as every bit of development was done on a branch, and only merged when complete and tested. But this was a different philosophy from continuous integration.\n\nBut it seems to me that for a team that uses continous integration, the groovy features of DVCS tools like Git would not be particularly relevant, and might even hinder the continuous integration process if merging changes requires extra steps that may be forgotten.\n\nI&#39;m sure there are other benefits of a DVCS (e.g. committing is very fast because it is local, presumably merging with the main branch could happen in the background while the developer carries on working).\n\nBut for this question, I&#39;m interested in how teams which use DVCS and continous integration reconcile the two seemingly conflicting philosophies. I&#39;m mainly interested in hearing from people who are actually doing this. (new)&quot;, &quot;Actually DVCS made continuous integration much easier.\n\nWith central VCS, every developer has the rights to commit directly in trunk and therefore he can commit buggy code. CI will detect it after the fact. So it&#39;s possible to have broken trunk even with CI.\n\nOn the other hand, the basic operations in DVCS world are branching and merging. Because merging is explicit and a separate process vs. commit to the trunk, one can always check the result of a merge before it lands on the trunk. I don&#39;t have experience with Git, but developers of Bazaar VCS have used this technique successfully for at least 3.5 years with the help of PQM tool. \n\nBasically PQM workflow looks as following: developer publishes his branch so it can be merged, then he sends a special e-mail to the PQM bot with merge instructions. When PQM receives a merge request, it makes a separate integration branch (copy of trunk), then merges the developer&#39;s branch and runs tests on the resulting code. If all tests are passed then the integration branch is pushed to trunk, otherwise the developer will receive an e-mail with the log of failing tests.\n\nRunning all tests for Bazaar project takes time, but tests are executed on demand on a separate server. Developers won&#39;t be blocked by merges and can continue to work on other tasks.\n\nAs result of PQM-based merge workflow the bzr trunk is never broken (at least as long as there are enough acceptance and regression tests). (new)&quot;, &#39;Since all DVCSs can be used with a workflow that uses a centralized repository, there is no problem.  Policy dictates that the developer must push their changes to the central repository in exactly the same way that policy dictates commits to a non-distributed VCS.  The additional tools that allow the developer to edit patch sets are not a hindrance in any way, and in fact make it much easier to generate a maintainable code base. (new)&#39;, &quot;Using a DVCS like Git doesn&#39;t prevent you from committing to a central repository regularly. However, it does mean that you can make intermediate commits locally and only push the changes to the central repository once you are done.\n\nThis way you have the benefits from source control even when you are halfway implementing a feature, without breaking the build for the other developers. (new)&quot;, &#39;Continuous Integration tools such as Hudson have support for DVCS, so I suspect this is possible to reconcile continuous integration with distributed version control.\n\nFirst, I think with DVCS using workflows such as topic branch workflow CI might be less necessary. Second, you can set up (single, central) continuous integration repository to which you push when you are ready, and hooks do CI.\n\n\n\nAdded 07-08-2009:  \n\nSee for example Continuous Integration Spring Cleaning post on GitHub Blog. (new)&#39;, &quot;Two ideas that I&#39;ve found help to explains this:\n\n\nDVCS separate commits from merges.\nCI runs against a repository that you choose.\n\n\nSo the heart of the matter is how the merges are made into the repositories that you want run a CI tool against. You can choose to have just one repository when you start.

It\&#39;s not the sexy distributed source control that all the cool kids are using, but, and this is the reason I am suggesting it, SVN should be an easy migration from CVS.  It\&#39;s established, well-used, and conceptually similar to CVS in some respects.  (Now, if your developers are so far removed from even that, it might not help.)  \n\nMany, many people have done this migration.  There are utilities out there to migrate your code from CVS to SVN (but not without some pain).\n\nIt should address most of your requirements (though how easy merging can be is debatable).\n\nBottom line is: your challenge isn\&#39;t the technology. It\&#39;s the adoption.  If your team doesn\&#39;t want to change, it won\&#39;t.  And sadly, any solution will be doomed.  You have to convince them they need a change first.  The best bet is to appeal to their laziness (I mean that in a positive way) and show that &quot;life will be better&quot; if they change. (new)&#39;, &quot;Any tool would need training. I would say that if you are confident that you will be moving to some other system then it makes complete sense to spend sometime on training the guys so that in the longer run it would be very helpful.\nBy looking at your requirement set I&#39;d say try looking at svn or sos.

For the sake of this question, assume feature flags are being handled by an external FFaaS.\nBased on my own reasoning I can see a few options:\n\nNever delete feature flags. Keep them around in case you may need them (ie for sunsetting a feature you are phasing out at some later date).\nPeriodically remove old feature flags that have remained on for X amount of time. This solves the code readability issue, but this breaks the trunk-based deploy paradigm as you lose out on the fallback measure of turning on/off a flag since the flag itself is being removed. You may also lose out on the above case where you&#39;d have to manually track down functionality to phase out, or maybe re-introduce feature flags back in to facilitate some similar transition.\n\nHow have people handled the logistics around using this development system?&quot;]</td><td class="s6" dir="ltr">[&#39;Feature flag complexity and debt management required&#39;, &#39;Use feature flags to safely integrate incomplete features&#39;, &#39;Use feature flags to decouple deployment from release&#39;]</td></tr><tr style="height: 30px"><th id="1569038740R44" style="height: 30px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 30px">45</div></th><td class="s7" dir="ltr">How do I re-integrate a svn and git repository without a common history?</td><td class="s8" dir="ltr">3864934</td><td class="s9" dir="ltr"><a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3864934/how-do-i-re-integrate-a-svn-and-git-repository-without-a-common-history">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3864934/how-do-i-re-integrate-a-svn-and-git-repository-without-a-common-history</a></td><td class="s10" dir="ltr">YANLIŞ</td><td class="s7" dir="ltr">[&#39;How do I re-integrate a svn and git repository without a common history? (new)&#39;, &#39;I have a github-based git repository that represents development up to a certain point, and then a svn repository, not initialized with git svn, that has further development.  I want to bring the svn changes into the git repository, start using the git repo for development, and push changes using git svn dcommit.  Is this possible?  Is it advisable?\n\nHere\&#39;s my specifics:\n\nWe started development on a WordPress plugin here:\n\nhttp://github.com/mrdoornbos/wpconfidentcaptcha\n\nMaster is at ef82b94a1232b44aae3e, and no further changes were made in github. \n\nWhen our application to wp-plugins.org was accepted, an empty svn repo was created for us: \n\nhttp://svn.wp-plugins.org/wp-confident-captcha/trunk@278927\n\nSomewhat modified files were then copied in (r256425).  Further changes were made, the last being r278935.\n\nWhat I want is for the SVN changes to be applied to master, along with the git svn metadata.\n\nHere\&#39;s what I have so far (takes about 4 minutes):\n\ngit clone git://github.com/mrdoornbos/wpconfidentcaptcha.git github_cc\ncd github_cc\ngit svn init --stdlayout --prefix=&quot;svn/&quot; http://svn.wp-plugins.org/wp-confident-captcha\ngit svn fetch --revision 256362:278935\n\n\nThis puts my github tree in origin/master, and my svn tree in svn/trunk (and all the tags in their own /svn branches as well).  There is no common ancestor between origin/master and svn/trunk.  I\&#39;m not sure where to go from here, or if there is a way to get the changes from svn/trunk onto origin/master, so that the head of the two repos have identical files, and let git svn dcommit work from origin/master.\n\nStarting over with a new github repo seems like the most straightforward way, and I wouldn\&#39;t be sad about losing the early history.  But, it seems like there should be a way to make this work with the existing github repo.\n\n(Edit: it looks like this was already asked as How to merge two branches without a common ancestor?, but without the git filter-branch example needed to make it work.  Unlike that question, these are public svn and git repos, so an answer with a working script is possible.) (new)&#39;, &#39;Here\&#39;s what worked for me:\n\n\nImport the git and svn histories into one repository,\nUse grafts and filter-branch to attach the svn tree to the git head, and\nReset the git-svn metadata to use the new history.\n\n\nImport Histories\n\nThis part was already described in the question:\n\n\n$ git clone git://github.com/mrdoornbos/wpconfidentcaptcha.git github_cc\n$ cd github_cc\n$ git svn init --stdlayout --prefix=&quot;svn/&quot; http://svn.wp-plugins.org/wp-confident-captcha\n$ git svn fetch --revision 256362:278935 # Takes about 4 minutes\n\n\nNow the history looks like this (friendly commit names in parens):\n\n\n$ git log --oneline --graph svn/trunk\n* d9c713a (svn-z) Bump stable to 1.5.4\n* 3febe34 (svn-y) Set display style to modal\n...

(other commits in git tree)\n* 8806456 (git-a) initial import\n\n\nThere are basically two independent histories in the repository, and it will take some gymnastics to join them.\n\nGraft, Merge, and Filter to Rewrite History\n\nIn part 2, I use a graft to make the last git commit the parent of the first\nsvn commit:\n\n\n$ GRAFT_PARENT_GIT=`git log --pretty=format:\&#39;%H\&#39; -1 master`\n$ GRAFT_FIRST_SVN=`git log --pretty=format:\&#39;%H\&#39; svn/trunk | tail -n1`\n$ echo $GRAFT_FIRST_SVN $GRAFT_PARENT_GIT &gt; .git/info/grafts\n$ cat .git/info/grafts\n5c48853d69cac0a4471fe96debb6ab2e2f9fb604 ef82b94a1232b44aae3ee5a998c2fa33acb6dcb0\n\n\nNow the merge is super smooth:\n\n\n$ git merge svn/trunk\nUpdating ef82b94..d9c713a\nFast-forward\n .gitignore                                   |    3 -\n(rest of merge lines removed)\n\n$ git log --oneline --graph master\n* d9c713a (svn-z) Bump stable to 1.5.4\n* 3febe34 (svn-y) Set display style to modal\n...

If I stick with the graft strategy, then everyone else who wants to work with the svn repo will have to recreate the graft themselves.  This is easy enough to script, but this is a case where I can do better, using git filter-branch.  This command is used to re-write git history, and has some really powerful options.  However, the default command does exactly what I want: recompute commit hashes, taking into account any \&#39;fake\&#39; parents added by grafts:\n\n\n$ git filter-branch master\nRewrite d9c713a99684e07c362b213f4eea78ab1151e0a4 (71/71)\nRef \&#39;refs/heads/master\&#39; was rewritten\n\n$ git log --oneline --graph master\n* 51909da (svn-z\&#39;) Bump stable to 1.5.4\n* 7669355 (svn-y\&#39;) Set display style to modal\n...

I need to point the svn trunk to the new commit, and then recreate the metadata.  This is the part that I\&#39;m not 100% sure about, but it works for me:\n\n\n$ GIT_NEW_SVN_TRUNK=`git log --pretty=format:\&#39;%H\&#39; -1 master`\n$ echo $GIT_NEW_SVN_TRUNK\n51909da6a235b3851d5f76a44ba0e2d128ded465\n$ git update-ref --no-deref refs/remotes/svn/trunk $GIT_NEW_SVN_TRUNK\n$ rm -rf .git/svn  # Clear the metadata cache\n$ git svn info     # Force a rebuild of the metadata cache\nMigrating from a git-svn v1 layout...\nData from a previous version of git-svn exists, but\n  .git/svn\n  (required for this version (1.7.3.1) of git-svn) does not exist.\nDone migrating from a git-svn v1 layout\nRebuilding .git/svn/refs/remotes/svn/trunk/.rev_map.b8457f37-d9ea-0310-8a92-e5e31aec5664 ...\nr256362 = 0a079cfe51e4641da31342afb88f8b47a0b3f2f3\nr256425 = aed565642990be56edc5d1d6be7fa9075bab880d\n(...more lines omitted)\nr278933 = 766935586d22770c3ef536442bb9e57ca3708118\nr278935 = 51909da6a235b3851d5f76a44ba0e2d128ded465\nDone rebuilding .git/svn/refs/remotes/svn/trunk/.rev_map.b8457f37-d9ea-0310-8a92-e5e31aec5664\nPath: .\nURL: http://svn.wp-plugins.org/wp-confident-captcha/trunk\n(...and the rest of the git svn info output from above)\n\n\nRecreate git-svn Metadata on Clone\n\nIf someone is cloning from my git repo, they get most of the git-svn metadata in the form of commit messages, but not enough to use git-svn themselves.

I learned a whole lot about git and git svn, but I\&#39;m not convinced the end goal was worth it.  For this use case (occasionally update an svn repository to the HEAD of the git repository), some custom scripts might have been more effective.

We have 30 web service solutions and 5 client solutions, the web services are quite dependent on each other (references contract dlls) and also share some common utility dlls. \n\nUntil now we have been happy with CruiseControl.net (37 CC projects, 5 clients, 30 WS, 1 utility project, 1 integration test project) all building and testing independent of each other. Before each deploy we trigger the builds for all projects in a well-defined order which gives us ready deploy-artifacts to deploy to some 7 different servers.\n\nUntil now we haven\&#39;t had any versioning of services, and each deploy would deploy the complete shebang.\n\nWe recently went into production and now we need to branch out the code, so that any further development does not mess up our ability to hotfix what is in production now.\n\nAlso we want to split up our efforts, spawning separate development efforts creating new clients or adding major functionality into existing clients/services, what I\&#39;m thinking is that we need the following\n\n\n 1 CI server &quot;frozen in time&quot; on a stable branch (what is in production at any given time) \n 1 CI server for regular development on minor issues / touchups on production (the trunk, release cycle = 1 month) \n 1 CI server per development effort (release cycle = 3-6 months)\n\n\nthat way we can always hotfix prod with very little effort, we will continue to improve prod based on user feedback on a monthly basis, and we can launch new major efforts on our SOA stack without interfering with the first two (until we merge the code that is :) )\n\nThe question is: what tools should we use for CI?\noptions as I see them:\n\n\n duplicate projects within our ccnet instance \n duplicate ccnet: xcopy CCnet to X locations on build machine, setup new services on different ports, tweak svn source, build location and deploy artifact location \n use a different CI server more suited to these problems \n\n\n1: I don\&#39;t like it (unwieldy, when is it green, all teams use same pool)\n\n2: I could see us doing this, but it feels a bit clunky\n\n3: Which server should we use? So far I\&#39;ve heard the names Hudson and Cruise, would these be applicable?\n\n4: Have I thought completely wrong? How do you other guys do CI on a SOA stack that is meant to support many teams\&#39; development efforts? (new)&#39;, &#39;I would throw Teamcity into the mix.  It uses a grid of build agents which may be able to give you a little more horsepower as well as ability to perform simultaneous builds.\n\nWith your sheer number of projects it might be tough to replicate your build three times within the same instance of any particular build server.  That would be over 100 projects to keep track of on the same page.  \n\nOption 2 is definitely viable although I might consider leveraging virtual machines, creating one build server image, and then hosting three instances of that which would result in three nice urls without using different ports as well as three identical setups to maintain.\n\nOne other consideration; perhaps you could collapse your 37+ projects into fewer ccnet builds by grouping related components and using nant\\msbuild\\ruby\\powershell scripting.  If you can get down to 15 builds then running all three variations in the same server instance becomes more viable.

The git log output of specific files right after the merge should show the same commits as the git log output of the files in each branch just before the merge.\n\nCurrent Approach:\nHere\&#39;s the solution I\&#39;ve come up with so far, based on approaches to merging one repository into another as a subfolder [1]:\n\n\nIn branchA, git move all files to a new folder subdirA and commit\nSwitch to master and start a merge with branchA: git merge -s ours --no-commit branchA\nRead the branch commits into index: git read-tree --prefix=/ -u branchA\nCommit: git commit -m &quot;Imported branchA into subdirA subfolder, with full history&quot;\n\n\nIssues:\nFollowing the above, I have a repository with the desired structure and containing the full history of all commits.  However, git log main.c shows the commits modifying main.c along both development paths.  Similarly, git log --follow subdirA/main.c shows the same full set of commits from both code bases.  Since these files were not actually merged into one, it means there are commits shown in one file\&#39;s history which did not actually modify that file - very confusing.\n\nThe only way I have found to separate the histories is to locate the first commit on the master and branchA branches after the branch point (assume we tag them as master_tag and branchA_tag, respectively) and using these to explicitly walk back along the appropriate path, for example: git log --ancestry-path master_tag.. main.c and git log --follow --ancestry-path branchA_tag.. subdirA/main.c.\n\nSome problems with the above are:\n\n\nMust manually specify the ancestor (and which ancestor, based on file\nlocation), otherwise get unrelated commit history for files\nMost GUI tools don\&#39;t allow (or not easily) such history viewing, and so show unrelated commits\nHistory output of the above doesn\&#39;t go back to before the split\n\n\nQuestion:\nSo, does anyone know a way to merge the branches together to achieve the repository structure defined above, yet keep the history of the two code bases from co-mingling after the merge?\n\nBackground:\nI have a git repository (legacy, migrated from SVN) which I am trying to reorganize.  The original SVN repo had two branches which are separate components of a larger project.  Imagine that someone split a single application into separate client/server components by making a new branch for the server, and keeping client development in the trunk, and that would be pretty close to the current state.  I would like to combine these two sets of code back into one branch, keeping the development history of both easily accessible after the fact.  The idea being that most development is done on the two components together, so keeping them in the same branch makes development, release, etc. simpler.\n\nReferences:\n[1] http://nuclearsquid.com/writings/subtree-merging-and-you/ (new)&#39;]</td><td class="s11" dir="ltr">[&#39;Maintain traceability and code history&#39;, &#39;Emphasis on shared code ownership&#39;, &#39;Simplifies the development workflow (+)&#39;]</td></tr><tr style="height: 30px"><th id="1569038740R49" style="height: 30px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 30px">50</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Merge a Subversion Branch back in to the Trunk and retain Revisions</td><td class="s3" dir="ltr">6616258</td><td class="s4" dir="ltr"><a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6616258/merge-a-subversion-branch-back-in-to-the-trunk-and-retain-revisions">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6616258/merge-a-subversion-branch-back-in-to-the-trunk-and-retain-revisions</a></td><td class="s5" dir="ltr">YANLIŞ</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">[&#39;Merge a Subversion Branch back in to the Trunk and retain Revisions (new)&#39;, &quot;My subversion project has a branch that&#39;s been used to develop a major new release of the product.  Now that the product has been launched, it&#39;s time to merge that branch back in to the Truck.\n\nI&#39;m using VisualSVN and TortoiseSVN to work with the SVN Server.\n\nBased on the TortoiseSVN documentation, the process seems to be:\n\n\n  a.  Check Out the Trunk to a Working\n  Copy.\n  \n  b.  Run the Merge command to apply the\n  Branch changes to the Working Copy.

Commit the Working Copy back to\n  the Trunk.\n\n\nWhile this process will result in the Trunk having all of the latest code, it also means that I lose all of the revisions in the Branch.  That&#39;s not acceptable.  I want to be able to see the progress during development, and keep all of the check-in comments.\n\nThere must be a better way to accomplish this merge, right?

(new)&#39;, &#39;I\&#39;m maintaining a project that was not initially using a version control system. Instead, there would be periodic snapshots of the code base saved into a backup folder, and there would occasionally be a makeshift branch created. When I got a hold of the project, I created a Subversion repository for it, committed each snapshot to the repository (using WinMerge to update the working copy each time) and made branches to correspond with the &quot;expensive&quot; copy branches in this backup folder system.\n\nNow that the project has been in Subversion for a while, and development has been done in real time in the trunk, I\&#39;ve been given a few older branch snapshot folders that were pulled from a developer\&#39;s machine. I found the right spot in the trunk\&#39;s history to retroactively branch from... however, my question now is this: If I create this branch, is there anything useful I can do with it? Can I retroactively merge this branch into trunk\&#39;s history, so there\&#39;s extra file history available for a file from the branch?\n\nEssentially, I would like to take this old &quot;expensive copy&quot; branch, create a branch from the appropriate spot in trunk\&#39;s history, copy the old branch over, commit each old backup copy to the Subversion branch, and then merge everything back in at the appropriate spot, as can be seen in the following crude ASCII-art diagram:\n\n     trunk: ... r107 -&amp;gt; r108 -\\-&amp;gt; r109 -&amp;gt; r110 -&amp;gt; .... -&amp;gt; r137 -&amp;gt; .... -&amp;gt; r394\nold branch:                    -&amp;gt; r395 -&amp;gt; r396 -&amp;gt; r397 -/ (r398)\n\n\nThe current repository\&#39;s revision is r394. Creating the branch would be r395. Committing a couple &quot;expensive&quot; copies would be r396 and r397. Merging back into trunk &quot;before&quot; the point in time represented by r137 would bring the repository to r398. Now, viewing the history of a file anywhere from r137 on would also include the changes committed in r396 + r397 and subsequently merged in r398.\n\nIs something like this possible without re-committing r137, then doing the merge, then re-committing r394 again (which I don\&#39;t think would give me what I want, anyway)? (new)&#39;, &#39;Subversion allows you to create a branch from an old snapshot, so you can branch off from r108 and commit your changes (r395-397) into that branch.  However, you can\&#39;t go back in and &quot;insert&quot; a commit into the tree\&#39;s history.  If you have administrator access to the server, you may be able to do some kind of kung fu with svnadmin dump to insert these changes into the tree at the appropriate time in the history, but it would throw off all of your revision numbers following that point (not to mention it would be a rather complicated procedure to go through).  I can\&#39;t imagine that process not causing all sorts of unexpected problems, especially with merge tracking.\n\nI tried to do something similar a while back, and I found that porting history from a non-organized system into a version control system was usually more trouble than it was worth.  Instead, I took a code snapshot and made a clean break; everything before that snapshot was still available on the old server using the old system, and from that point onward all development would be done in the Subversion repository.  We didn\&#39;t lose any information and all of the history was still there, but it required developers to access the old server to get to it.  It was annoying at first, but after a couple of months, the Subversion repo had developed enough of a history of its own that the builds from the old system became generally unused and were migrated out to an archive server.  Since you\&#39;ve already set up your Subversion repo and included historical builds it\&#39;s probably too late to make a clean split between legacy code and current code, but the idea still holds.  You can add this new historical data to a server/fileshare that is hosting your historical builds and if anyone wants to see the most detailed history of a file beyond revision 200 (or whatever the rev number was when you stopped committing old builds and started doing active development), they can check the server.

I am using the traditional nomenclature of &quot;trunk&quot;, &quot;branches&quot;, and &quot;tags&quot;.\n\nI essentially have a folder (backend) that has a number of php files that drive a live production site, and a folder (backend_dev) that has a variation of the same files that power a development version of the site.\n\nI would like to initially set my repository up such that /trunk/php/ contains my files from &quot;backend_dev&quot; and /branches/live-site/php/ contains the files from &quot;backend&quot;.

If not, what is ideology I should follow to handle a situation where I have multiple (manual) versions of pre-existing code.\n\nTo be clear, what I have tried is to svn import my &quot;backend_dev&quot; folder to /trunk/php and svn import my &quot;backend&quot; folder to /branches/live-site/php and use svn merge to see if the branch would operate properly.

I can easily get the SVN repo converted to GIT but I can never get it in a state where the commit ids actually match.\nCurrently the approach that gets me the closest seems to be\ngit svn clone -T trunk URL --no-minimize-url --no-metadata -r1:10 --preserve-empty-dirs \n\nI&#39;m using the -r on only a few revisions so it&#39;s faster.\nThe author actually gets same email (name@UUID) and the UUID matches the git repo converted in 2018.\nThe problem seems to be that the SVN history starts with 2 commits that contain only folders and commit message - these commits are being ignored for me but somehow for the older migration they resulted in a git commit with just the message.\nExample:\nsvn\ncommit A: create dir 1\n\ncommit B: create dir 2\n\ncommit C: create some files in dir 1 and 2\n\noriginal git migration result:\ncommit A: commit message only\n\ncommit B: commit message only\n\ncommit C: create some files in dir 1 and 2\n\nmy current efforts using git svn:\ncommit C: create some files in dir 1 and 2\n\nattempt using SubGit:\nsubgit import --trunk trunk --username user --svn-url URL)\n\ncommit A: commit message only (modified with notes)\n\ncommit B: commit message only (modified with notes)\n\ncommit C: create some files in dir 1 and 2 (commit message modified with notes)\n\nnotes on SubGit - this approach is pretty close (based on the documentation i&#39;m pretty sure i can get the commit message fixed).\nThe problem for me is that if I do not provide the authors file instead of ending up with &#39;user@uuid&#39; I end up with &#39;user@localdomain&#39;.\nPossible workaround would be to provide export the authors from the original migration and provide this as authors file ?\nAnyone got any suggestions on how to do this ?\nIf i cannot get to the same commit ids on git side is there some sane way of &amp;quot;merging&amp;quot; two git repos if I can find the common ancestor (even though id&#39;s don&#39;t match) ? (new)&quot;, &#39;You might consider creating a separate clone of the svn repo starting at the revision right before the revision where the oldest branch you want to clone this time starts and you only clone the branches you care about.... then you might move those revisions onto the other git repo where the other branches are (using patches or using a repo that has access to the two git repos as remotes).... if you use the same revision as the base, git should not have any problem applying the revisions that came out of the new clone.... and I accept I am oversimplifying a lot and you might get a number of corner cases but the basic logic is sound. (new)&#39;, &quot;This is default SubGit&#39;s behavior -- if it&#39;s not given an author mapping (or in case if no match for an SVN username is found) then it generates a Git identity using the SVN user name and the default domain (which is set by core.defaultDomain SubGit configuration setting or default-domain command option). So if you need SubGit to set certain Git user identity for a given commit, then it&#39;s indeed better to provide it with an authors mapping file. If can be done with the &amp;quot;authors-file&amp;quot; command option (which probably you know, but still :))\nsubgit import --trunk trunk --username user --authors-file &amp;lt;AUTHORS_FILE_PATH&amp;gt; --svn-url URL\n\nI didn&#39;t get completely what is wrong with the commit messages, assume that the commit messages in Git does not match those in SVN? If yes, then this can also be with SubGit, yet not with subgit import one-liner, it would require import with preliminary configuration and the configuration file editing. So, first run the following command to prepare a Git repository for import:\nsubgit configure --snv-url URL &amp;lt;GIT_REPO&amp;gt;\n\nwhere GIT_REPO is a path to the new Git repository for the import.\nAfter the repository is prepared, edit the GIT_REPO/subgit/config file, set core.defaultDomain and core.authorsFile if needed, set correct mapping in [svn] section and the configure desired commit message with the svn.gitCommitMessage setting, here are a little more details about this setting:\nhttps://subgit.com/documentation/config-options.html#svn.gitCommitMessage\nafter the configuration file is set, the import can be started with short command:\nsubgit import GIT_REPO\n\nAs for the Git commit notes -- SubGit always creates the notes, but they don&#39;t affect commits SHA1, so no actions are needed for the notes.\nNote, by the way, that authors and commit messages are not the only setting that may affect commits SHA1, there are also settings like &#39;svn.excludePath` or &#39;translate.createEmptyGitCommits&#39;.

(new)&#39;, &quot;Our team&#39;s branching strategy is a mix between git-flow and trunk-based. A feature is developed in a branch, then deployed to a staging environment for approval, then merged into master and deployed to production. Lately a problem has been brought up that i don&#39;t even know how to search for.\nI&#39;ll set up the context and then the problem.\n\nAt stage 1 we have a master branch deployed to prod, and two undeployed feature branches: green and orange. They may or may not be from the same dev team.\nAt stage 2, for testing and business purposes we need to have both unrelated features in a staging environment, so we create a staging/features as a staging branch from master, and merge green and orange into it.\nAt stage 3 more work is put into those features and they go to the staging branch. Each feature remains independent because they get approvals from different stakeholders, so one being approved doesn&#39;t mean the other one is also approved, and one being approved does not require to &amp;quot;wait&amp;quot; for the other. They are independent from each other. The staging branch cannot be merged into a feature for the same reason (it&#39;ll carry the opposite feature).\nAt stage 4 green feature is approved to master, so it merges and all other features have to pull from master. Shortly after, orange is approved so it merges to master and the dev cycle ends.\nNow the problem.\n\nStage 1 and 2 are similar but with 3 feature branches instead of 2.\nAt stage 3 development continues and the features are merged into the staging branch, all good.\nAt stage 4, blue wants to merge new code into staging but has conflicts with existing code.\nIf I solve the conflicts at the staging branch, that commit cannot be merged back into any feature, nor into master. I may even have conflicts with all the other features.\nToday my solution is to remember which feature had conflicts and apply the fixes when both go into master, but it&#39;s extremely fragile. Keeping notes elsewhere is also prone to be forgotten when a merge is performed.\nIs there a better way to keep solved conflicts in this branching strategy and not rely on a person&#39;s memory?&quot;, &quot;It turns out the name of the branching strategy you&#39;re using is Gitworkflow, and it is the strategy that the Git project uses, so you&#39;re in good company there. Here&#39;s a article with a diagram which looks just like yours. Note that your staging/features branch is called next in Gitworkflow, and I will refer to that branch as next in the rest of this answer. The key point here is that you should occasionally blow away next and reset it to master to clean up the cruft. This also helps reduce the chance of conflicts on next, so the more often you can do it the better. (In one of the repos I work in that uses this workflow we currently reset next every two weeks.)\nAs for conflicts, there are 2 main types:\n\nConflicts that are on both next and master due to new stuff that appeared in both places.\nConflicts that are on next because of another feature branch, or a previous version of your own feature branch that conflicts with the current version.\n\nType 1 conflicts are easy because you just do whatever you would do normally- perhaps rebase feature onto master, or merge master into feature if you prefer.\nType 2 conflicts, which are the type in you are inquiring about, are a little more complicated because oftentimes you only need to resolve them on next. Typically in this scenario I either make a temporary branch just for merging into next, or I start maintaining two branches for the feature- the regular one, my-feature which is always &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot; and ready to be merged into master, and my-feature_next which is just for merging into next and resolving conflicts.\nTips for this workflow:\n\nWhen creating your feature branch, if you start from git merge-base next master you may be able to initially merge into both cleanly. The more often you reset next to master the more likely this is to work.\nIf you have many merges into next with lots of fixups, sometimes it&#39;s easier to base your branch off of next and work solely there by only adding new commits to your branch. When you&#39;re completely ready you can squash those commits down to a small number of &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; commits and then use the rebase --onto option for prepping your branch for merging into master.

(new)&#39;, &#39;In version control in commercial development, there are often multiple branches of a project. In my mercurial-managed projects I often have a stable and a trunk version, which descend from some common parent, like this:\n\n      V8     (the parent of both V8-stable and V9, revisions 1..100)\n       |\n       +---  V8_stable  (bug fix branch, revisions 101 to 500 )\n       |\n       +---  V9_trunk   (trunk, revisions 501 to 1000 )\n\n\nAll the above versions of the project have a file, we\&#39;ll call it helloworldapp.py. These samples are in Python because it is the most pseudo-code-like language I know, but the question is not a Python question.    Now, In mercurial you can branch using clones, or you can use Mercurial\&#39;s built in branching capabilities.  In this example, I\&#39;m branching using clones of entire repositories.\n\nHere is the V8 helloworldapp.py which is the common parent rev:\n\n# helloworldapp.py rev 100 (v8)\ndef func1(a,b,c,d,e):\n    print &quot;stuff&quot;\ndef func2(a,b,c,d,e):\n    func1(a,b,c,d,e)\ndef func3(a,b,c,d,e):\n    func2(a,b,c,d,e)\ndef func4(a,b,c,d,e):\n    func3(a,b,c,d,e)\ndef func5(a,b,c,d,e):\n    func4(a,b,c,d,e)\ndef func6(a,b,c,d,e):\n    func5(a,b,c,d,e)\ndef func7(a,b,c,d,e):\n    func6(a,b,c,d,e)\n\nfunc7(1,2,3,4,5)\n\n\nHere is revision 500, part of V8-stable branch:\n\n# helloworldapp.py rev 500 (v8_stable)\ndef func1(a,b,c,d,e):\n    print &quot;stuff&quot;\n\ndef morestuff():\n   print &quot;morestuff&quot;\n\nmorestuff()\nfunc1(1,2,3,4,5)\n\n\nHere is revision 1000 part of the V9 trunk branch:\n\n# helloworldapp.py rev 1000 (v9_trunk)\ndef func1(a,b,c,d,e):\n    print &quot;stuff&quot;\n\ndef func4(a,b,c,d,e):\n    morestuff()\n    morestuff()\n    morestuff()\n    func1(a,b,c,d,e)\n\ndef morestuff():\n   print &quot;hello&quot;\n\nfunc4(1,2,3,4,5)\n\n\nThe above files are very short examples of a condition that occurs when branches get out of sync, in file-oriented version control, and which causes me difficulty, when I have to manage the &quot;stable to trunk&quot; merge-ups (via pull and then merge).\n\nHere\&#39;s the situation that you end up with when merging.  Note that in the real world, the problems are usually magnified by about 100x to 1000x for me. I often end up with 5000+ lines of conflicts that Hg merge cannot solve, in hundreds of files, which require me to merge each one manually in KDiff3.\n\nAside from not letting branches ever get out of sync ever, what can a Mercurial user do to make merging in such situations easier?  In the situation I have illustrated above, &quot;working at line 6 on branch A of a file&quot; is the same as &quot;working at line 6 on branch B of a file&quot;, and the line-by-line merges create merge conflicts, where two users were actually working (in their own minds) on different functions in a file.  By the act of deleting a no-longer-used-function from one file, because it\&#39;s no longer needed, you now almost ensure more chance of merge conflicts.  You almost have to institute rules like &quot;no moving or deleting lines in upstream stable branches, ever&quot;.  I know that if you were using a Smalltalk image-based version control system, the accident of &quot;what line is it on&quot; would no longer enter into it.  If the diff-tool used by Mercurial understood Python, it could do a better job at Python code, at the expense of making it probably not work well at all on C# code.  So this is the state of the art in file-based programming and DVCS tools. Fine.\n\nSo, in the merge situation pictured here,\n\n\n\n(click here for larger version)\n\n*\nWhat I see is merge conflicts where I wish it could figure out that I either want all or none of the &quot;morestuff&quot; function:\n\n\n\nWhat I wish I got (automatically):\n\n\n\nI have posted sample repositories on bitbucket as: \n    helloworldapp_v9\n    helloworldapp_v8_stable\n\nTo try this &quot;most simple example I could construct of what happens when you are trying to how to resolve merge conflicts&quot;, clone one of the above, and then pull from the other, and then merge.  In the end my question is: How does a professional user of Mercurial deal with this kind of situation?  Understand that this example is contrived but shows some of the complexity that users of DVCS tools encounter, but in the real world, these conflicts are often far more complex than the simple case I am showing here.  I have learned to deal with most small and simple conflicts fairly quickly using TortoiseHG and KDIFF3, but I find that merge-hell is much less of a problem than I remember it being with Subversion or Perforce, but still, I don\&#39;t think that either (a) the programmer (me) or (b) my tools have done all that can be done to help manage and understand this complexity. I have a feeling that alternative solutions and tools and working strategies for using Mercurial exist that I have not yet tried or learned about.  Maybe MQ and Rebase? (new)&#39;, &quot;Actually, in my experience, the real world doesn&#39;t usually look like that for two reasons:\n\n\nWe merge much more frequently (from v8 to v9 in your example), so that Mercurial knows incrementally how things are to fit together between the two branches. Five hundred changesets is a lot of changes to piece together in one step (and I&#39;ve done it that way before!).\nWhen merging our branches, our changes don&#39;t collide as brutally as your example. With less collision and more context surrounding each change, the merge tools do a much better job at putting them together.\n\n\nWe do have collisions and need to figure out how to put them together manually, which can be a big headache if we put it off. Once we do that, though, the common ancestor is now that merge and we don&#39;t need to revisit that collision again. By merging more frequently you decrease the number of changeset since the common ancestor.\n\nI&#39;d be interested in re-running your example with periodic merges from V8_stable into V9_trunk. I&#39;d also be interested if you added some text between function defs to give hg some more context to separate out the changes.\n\n\n\nHaving attempted to try the more frequent merges with your example, it didn&#39;t work very well. If your versions diverge that much (only 15%-25% the same), they become fundamentally different codebases and merging doesn&#39;t make sense anymore. At that point, I try to factor out the pieces into separate files to allow both versions (and my sanity!) to co-exist in peace.

Cherry-picking the areas to be merged would cause us to resolve the trunk-branch conflicts twice (one when merging trunk revisions to the FB, and once more when merging back).\nRepository size: trunk changes might be significant for a large code base, and copying the differences files (unlike SVN copy) from trunk elsewhere may be a significant overhead.\n\n\nInstead, we do what we call &quot;re-branching&quot;. In this case, when a significant chunk of trunk changes is needed, a new feature branch is opened from current trunk, and the merge is always downward (Feature branches -&gt; trunk -&gt; stable branches). This does not go along SVN book guidelines and developers see it as extra pain. \n\nHow do you handle this situation? (new)&#39;, &quot;From SVN v1.5, merging is done rev-by-rev. Cherry-picking the areas to be merged would cause us to resolve the trunk-branch conflicts twice (one when merging trunk revisions to the FB, and once more when merging back)\n\n\nThen you are doing something wrong!\n\nLet&#39;s see:\n\ntrunk    fb\n ---------\\\n r1-10    |\n r11-20   |\n r20-30   |\n\n\nGenerally if you want changes done in 11-20, then best practice is to merge 1-20 to fb\nand get everything there.\n\nThen when fb is done, merge 20-30 and then copy fb to trunk (no merge!).\n\nIf you decide to merge only r11:20, ok, at end you will need to merge r1:10 and r20:30\nand then copy fb to trunk.\n\nThere is no way you merge changes twice!\n\nI assume that you probably do following:\n\ncopy trunk-&amp;gt;fb\nmerge 11:20 -&amp;gt; fb.\nmerge fb-1:30 -&amp;gt; trunk !!!!! WRONG\n\n\nYou can&#39;t do this because you would merge 11:20 twice. You should always merge code in\none direction only. \n\nCorrect way:\n\ncopy trunk-&amp;gt;fb\nmerge 1:20 -&amp;gt; fb.\nmerge 21:30 -&amp;gt; fb (now fb=trunk+feature)\ncopy fb -&amp;gt; trunk\n\n\nEdit\n\nSo the correct steps are:\n\n\nCreate feature branch (FB) from trunk (copy trunk to feature branch with svn-copy)\n\nFB_0=trunk_0\n\nWork on FB.\n\nFB_1=FB_0 + change_a\n\nMerge all upcoming changes from trunk to FB.\n\ntrunk_1=trunk_0 + tr_change_a;\nFB_2 = FB_1 + (trunk_1 - trunk_0) == trunk_0 + change_a + tr_change_a\n\nWork on FB\n\nFB_3 = FB_2 + change_b\n\nMerge all upcoming unmerged changes from trunk to FB.\n\ntrunk_2=trunk_1 + tr_change_n;\nFB_4 = FB_3 + (trunk_2 - trunk_1) == trunk_0 + change_a + change_b + tr_change_a + tr_change_b\n\nAt this point we have a feature branch that consists of all new features and\nall changes in trunk. So we just copy the difference between two branches.\n\ntrunk_3 = trunk_2 + (FB_4 - trunk_2) = FB_4 = trunk_0 + change_a + change_b + tr_change_a + tr_change_b\n\n\nNow FB deleted as trunk has all changes we need.\n\nThe last step is executed by:\n\nsvn merge /path/to/trunk@LatestRev /path/to/branches/fb@LatestRev .\nsvn ci\n\n\nOr in ordinary language take difference between trunk and branch and put them to trunk\nmaking them equivalent.\n\n\nThis pattern is described in http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.4/svn.branchmerge.commonuses.html#svn.branchmerge.commonuses.patterns.feature\n\nNow if this does not work for you, then I don&#39;t understand the question.\n\nEdit2: For svn-1.5\n\nWhen working with svn-1.5 you can merge much simpler:\n\nWhen you work on feature branch you just merge changes from trunk time to time:\n\n$ svn merge /path/to/trunk\nSolve conflicts\n$ svn ci\n\n\nIt will line up your FB with all changes in trunk. At the end of FB you run this procedure\nonce more to make sure that everything is up-to date. The you go to trunk and run\n\n$ svn merge --reintegrate /path/to/fb\n$ svn ci\n\n\nIn the last one there should be no conflicts if you are working as shown. (new)&quot;, &#39;After research:\n\nAfter many brainstorming sessions at visionmap, F2F discussions including Artyom, opening an SVN book case, etc - it looks like this is not possible to do. A feature branch is totally not like working copy. The only working way to update it is recreate a new branch, as described above. (new)&#39;, &quot;We&#39;re an small company, so I don&#39;t known if our solution will apply to your situation. What we do is a rev-by-rev merging from trunk to the stable branch. We can do it in 2 different ways:\n- Really needed fix, we merge just after committing to trunk\n- Dangerous fix/change. We wait some days until the change is proofed in trunk and then we merge\n\nWith this continuous merging we avoid tons of conflicts.\n\nMy 2 cents. (new)&quot;, &quot;Sadly  everything mentioned can be thought of as hacks.  Updating from trunk on a branch can lead to very serious problems when bringing it back into trunk and opens the possibility for the worst of all conflicts, tree conflicts. This is because directories are not treated as first class citizens. The best approach is to use Mercurial with the \nSVN extension as your standard SVN client. It allows you to keep using SVN while getting the power of Mercurial&#39;s folder handling.\n\nThen on the wworkstation side you can use a number of approaches which provides a array of features to suit many  situations over SVN&#39;s single one. You can use regular patching, patch queues, updating from a local copy of trunk without affecting the shared trunk and various other approaches.\n\nThis approach works around all of SVN&#39;s downn sides. I had tto switch to this approach because of similar circumstances. Even if you don&#39;t use this approach immediately you should at least give it a try ASAP. (new)&quot;, &#39;I think I have to take up the cudgels for @Artyom here. I too think that if you have to\n\n\n  resolve the trunk-branch conflicts twice\n\n\nsomething is wrong. And I think @Artyoms argument/solution is quite solid.\n\nI believe one of the minor things @Artyom could have written clearer is that in the end where you &quot;copy&quot; fb to trunk you do not use svn copy but svn merge (or svn merge --reintegrate). This might be the reason you do not find the &quot;copy-merge&quot; pattern in Common Branching Patterns.\n\nAs I am struggling with understanding what you are doing up until now, I am unsure what else to say.\n\nHere is what I hear:\n\n\n  Instead, we do what we call\n  &quot;re-branching&quot;. In this case, when a\n  significant chunk of trunk changes is\n  needed, a new feature branch is opened\n  from current trunk, ...\n\n\nNow you have a new branch (let us call it b2) that is equivalent to trunk, right? And where is the &quot;significant chunk of trunk changes needed&quot;? I assume in fb?\n\n\n  ...and the merge is\n  always downward (Feature branches -&gt;\n  trunk -&gt; stable branches).\n\n\nBut as you just created b2 from trunk there is nothing to merge into trunk, no? And you are not merging changes from b2 to fb either (as this would be the same as merging trunk to fb...). So how do the &quot;significant chunks of changes&quot; get into fb? And once they are there, why would you want to merge them back to trunk (since this is where they came from in the first place)?\n\nActually the following links the section called “Tracking Merges Manually&quot; and/or the section called “Merging a Whole Branch to Another&quot; provided in the SVN 1.4 documentation (I know, you do not use SVN 1.4 but I believe it applies anyway) under Common Branching Patterns might help to clear some things up. These links are &quot;missing&quot; in the 1.5 documentation (probably because of the new --reintegrate option in merge).\n\nYou really seem to be merging the same changes twice and I really think you should not (need to) do that.

It is especially unnecessary during the startup phase of a project.\n\nOne problem is that most features take more than 1 or 2 days to complete. If there is a code review process, this can take another day or two. If there are multiple developers working on separate branches for several days in an immature (rapidly changing) codebase, there is a lot of opportunities for the branches to diverge, leading to merge conflicts, duplication of effort, etc.  Sometimes a branch is created off another feature branch that has not yet been merged for some reason.  This is also prone to errors, for example a PR can have the wrong &quot;base branch&quot;.  Sometimes after a PR is merged I try to merge trunk/master into my feature branch, and this has led to painful merges, where every file modified shows up as a conflict. \n\nHowever, some kind of code-review practice is necessary, so I want to know what other teams and companies have used. \n\nI could imagine a system where a feature is identified by a tag in the commit message.  For example &quot;[XYZ-1234] added new component&quot;. The tag identifies the ticket, and the message gives more details. So everyone could be committing to a &quot;dev&quot; branch, and synchronizing often, and when a feature is determined to be complete, all the commits associated with that feature could be code reviewed then merged into &quot;master&quot; (by searching the commit messages).  This seems simpler and better to me, so I\&#39;m not sure why a system like this is not created and used. (new)&#39;, &#39;Based on your description, it seems all the developers are work own theirs own feature  branches, and then the create PRs to merge the feature branches into master branch.\n\nAnd for the suggestions, you should create a branch such as dev for all developers to co-work on the branch. And the work flow as below:\n\n\nAll the developers work on theirs own feature branches.\nWhen developers finish their work, they should merge their feature branches into dev branch.\nThen create a PR to merge dev into master branch.\nAnd for the next time when developers develop new work, they can create new feature branches from dev branch. And since some feature branches may live for a few weeks and there may have new changes on dev branch during the weeks, developers can rebase these feature branches on the top of latest dev branch by executing git pull origin dev --rebase command on feature branches. (new)&#39;, &quot;A normal trunk-base flow should serve well in your case.\n\nThe problem you are facing could possibly be soothed by some extra practices.\n\n\nPain in merge conflict\n\n\nhere we assume the feature branch are not shared\ndeveloper should frequently merge master (assuming you are using master as trunk) into their feature branch, or frequently rebase their feature branch on latest master.\nBefore pull request really merged back to master, try rebasing/squashing to lastest master.  This keep master history more linear.\n\nFeature branch based on another feature branch\n\n\nI expect here you are sharing a feature branch.  Try to avoid it if possible.  It makes your merging and handling easier\n\nfeature branch naming\n\n\nI&#39;d have the feature branch name and commit message all contains the ticket number. Coz feature branch will be gone after feature is completed so you can only refer to your commit message to identify what changes is related to which issue.\n\n\n\nNot sure if it helps (new)&quot;]</td><td class="s6" dir="ltr">[&#39;Reduce merge conflicts (+)&#39;, &#39;Simplifies the development workflow (+)&#39;, &#39;Promote frequent and rapid integration (CI) (+)&#39;, &#39;Rebase before merge&#39;, &#39;Squashing commits into logical units&#39;, &#39;Use a single shared trunk&#39;, &#39;Commit frequently (daily)&#39;, &#39;Mandatory code review policy&#39;, &#39;Use commit message tags to identify features for later code review and traceability (new)&#39;]</td></tr><tr style="height: 30px"><th id="1569038740R66" style="height: 30px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 30px">67</div></th><td class="s7" dir="ltr">SVN branch by feature for beginners</td><td class="s8" dir="ltr">32746659</td><td class="s9" dir="ltr"><a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32746659/svn-branch-by-feature-for-beginners">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32746659/svn-branch-by-feature-for-beginners</a></td><td class="s10" dir="ltr">YANLIŞ</td><td class="s7" dir="ltr">[&#39;SVN branch by feature for beginners (new)&#39;, &#39;I work with a PL/SQL team that is used to version control with SourceSafe which is based on a lock per file. One user &quot;owns&quot; the file. When delivering new code, someone consolidate manually all the changes, and the consolidation pack is deployed on the staging environment. If something is broken, they just remove the broken code from the consolidation pack and then staging again. If everything is OK, they deploy the consolidation pack in production.\n\nNow they have to code in Java, and use SVN. This is a big change. We setup a strategy for development and deployment but we are not 100% satisfied.\n\nBranches:\n\n\ntrunk: The code is stable and deployed in production.\nfeature: Each feature is developed in a specific branch created from trunk.\nmaintenance: This branch is used to fix production bug, it was created from trunk just after deployment in production. We just have to handle N-1 version.\n\n\nBefore deploying we want to test the new feature and the maintenance bugfixes into a staging environment. Our idea is to merge the maintenance and feature branches we want to test into trunk. Deploy trunk in the staging environment.\n\nCase 1: New feature needs bugfix\n\n\nFix is done in the feature branch\nWhen fixed, feature branch is merged into trunk\n\n\nQ: What if the feature is not working because of a maintenance bugfix? Should the feature fix be done in trunk?\n\nCase 2: New feature is not production ready, we can\&#39;t release it in the short term\n\n\nSince the feature has been merged into trunk, we have to revert that branch from. \n\n\nShould we revert all the merges since the latest production release, and remerge only the wanted branches?\n\nCase 3: The staging is lasting 2 weeks but bugfix production still needs to be commited\n\n\nThe maintenance branch has been merged into trunk.\n\n\nOn which branch should we commit the bugfix during the staging period. If we commit them on the maintenance branch, we might lose these changes because when staging is done, trunk will be in production, and a new maintenance branch will be created from that trunk. So the new maintenance branch will miss the commits from the old maintenance branch done during the staging period.\n\nAs you can see, a lot of question unanswered, and a complex strategy with a lot of merge (time consuming and error-prone). From the blogs I read on the subject, I think our branches setup is faily common though. We are open to any modification, the goal is to have a simple and understandable strategy. (new)&#39;, &#39;This seems way too broad and/or too opinion-based to be a good fit for SO, but...\n\nCase 1:\n\nIf you don\&#39;t merge bigfixes from MAINT back to &quot;branches-for-work&quot; - you done branching|merging bad. I.e. for previously merged to trunk feature-branch you have (from my POV):\n\n\nwrite bugfix in feature-branch, merge new range (auttomatically detected for not-so-ancient SVN) into trunk, which was previously already synced with maintenance. &quot;if the feature is not working because of a maintenance bugfix&quot; you have to add new bugfix in feature-branch for &quot;getting maintenance compability&quot; and merge again\n\n\nBut beware: cyclic merges in SVN (even freshest) can produce strange and bad results with Tree Conflicts at unpredictable (so-so) points\n\n\n  Should the feature fix be done in trunk?\n\n\nThis is more question of local policy, but for &quot;Stable trunk&quot; I prefer to see trunk with only mergesets from different branches in it (easier discoverable history)\n\nCase 2:\n\nIn case of mergesets-only (to some degreee, see below) trunk, you have to reverse merge single mergeset in trunk, with not-ready-to production feature merged to trunk.

Given below are some parameters I&#39;ve collected:\n\n\nHalf of the development teams use the Integration view, development view, rebase and delivery methodology. The rest just work straight on their integration stream with private views as if it was trunk.\nall the teams use baselines for labeling versions. \nThey claim to be facing merging problems with Clearcase-UCM, so the alternative must have merging capabilities well designed.\nZero maintenance - there is no VCS admin for the tool.\nWindows based development, so the tool must have a good win32 support.\nIDE integration (eclipse).\nMac-OS support.\nnice to have: migration tool.\n\n\nWhat tool will fit both working methods (neither of the groups is going to adopt the other method)? \nI have svn, mercurial, and git as alternative so far. will one of them fit? Are there any other choices? (new)&quot;, &quot;I can&#39;t speak for the migration tool, but mercurial has worked great for us. We have a mix of WinXP, Mac OS X, and Linux people and there haven&#39;t been any snags. I don&#39;t use an IDE, but I believe Aptana acquired the pydev group (Python for Eclipse) so I wouldn&#39;t be too surprised if they have that. (new)&quot;, &#39;Whe using UCM and creating a baseline, you effectively identify a revision of a predefined sub-group of a repository (the UCM component defined within a Vob, unless you have define one all Vob as a component)\n\nSo if you are using SVN, Git or Mercurial, you must realize each of your UCM components will actually be one (SVN-Git-or-Mercurial) repository.\n\nPlus, you will need to recreate the notion of UCM dependencies (the &quot;edit baseline dependencies&quot;, which none of those tools have.)\n\nThe closest approximation principle is described in this SO answer: it can be done but remains manual.\n\nNote: &quot;Zero maintenance - there is no VCS admin for the tool.&quot;... errr good luck with that one:\n\n\nbackup\nDRP (Disaster Recovery Plan)\nright access for certain repositories with &quot;sensitive&quot; content\nscripting and client encapsulation for certain operations\n....\n\n\nNo mater what tool you will choose, you will need an admin (not full time, but still pretty involved in admin tasks)\n\n\n\nRegarding &quot;tracability&quot;, mainly represented by the activities in UCM, but also by the streams hierarchy allowing to define a merge workflow, it does not translate well in Git/Mercurial: those tools are different.\n\nFor Git, a commit is the closest thing of an activity, especially since a \&#39;git rebase -i\&#39; (rebase interactive) allows you to redefine the content of a commit (a bit like when you select again an activity for a new checkout)\nRegarding merging, since they are so easy in Git or Mercurial, there is no real &quot;merge workflow&quot; formally defined through deliver/rebase operation.\nRather private branches are created and used/merge as the user see fit, some of those branches being published to another external repository. (new)&#39;, &quot;To some extent the technical parts are the easy ones to deal with - you can use it with MacOSX or you can&#39;t etc. The tricky bits are the the &#39;services&#39; that you buy as part of the CC license, and those will not be obvious to developers, nor will developers necessarily even care.\n\nYour company&#39;s assets will be sitting in repositories that are managed by the tool you select and moving from one tool to another is not always that easy. So, much depends on the lifecycle of your products. Are they out in the market for 6 months, 6 years or even longer? The problem with some of these tools have only been out there for a few years, and they are subject to fashion to some extent. Git is in favour, Bazaar seems to have fallen out of favour.\n\nMy advice would be to look at what Rational provide under your current arrangement and try to find a tool supported by a service provider that will give you an equivalent service. Then compare costs.\n\nYou may also want to think about how you will get your developers off ClearCase and onto the new tool. In my experience migrating tools is 80% about people. They may moan bitterly about it at the moment, but when things don&#39;t go so well with the new tool in your zero maintenance scenario then their view may change ... been there.\n\nIf they are having trouble merging there is no guarantee that going to another tool will solve it. If the problem persists after migration you will know it&#39;s not the tool that&#39;s the problem. \n\nAny tool can be zero maintenance. It breaks, you don&#39;t fix it, and migrate to another &#39;tool of the month&#39;.

Bugfix-only releases are usually point releases maintained in the parent release branch.  Releases with new functionality usually become a new version/branch.\n\nThe source control tree looks like this:\n\n- trunk - dev\n  - Product ABC\n    - ABC 1.0\n      -  ABC 1.0.1 (point release same branch)\n    - ABC 2.0\n  - Product XYZ\n    - XYZ 1.0\n    - XYZ 2.0\n\n\nDev is obviously our development branch and is not expected to be stable.  Dev changes that pass peer review are promoted to the trunk which I like to think of as stable but still development code.  As we add new features to the trunk (usually in response to a customer project) we eventually get close to releasing and I branch off of the trunk into a branch like &quot;Product ABC 2.0&quot; above.\n\nThe nightmare develops when we start fixing defects in the release branch.  We want to merge them back into the trunk but it should go into the dev branch first - however since the branch was created from the trunk this isn\&#39;t possible unless we do a baseless merge back to dev.  Likewise if we make changes in dev and move them into the trunk and want to merge those into a product branch again it isn\&#39;t possible without a baseless merge.\n\nThis just seems to be such a convoluted branching plan that I\&#39;m convinced it\&#39;s totally wrong or that there is no good way to branch with our model and how many releases we do and maintain for years for different customers.\n\nThe MS guidance (even the advanced advanced plan) seems to be based on simpler release scenarios.  Is there anything I am missing here that would bring some sanity back? (new)&#39;, &#39;Having seen many branching strategies, my initial advice is very straightforward:\n\nAim to the simplest branching plan as possible\n\nIn other words, don\&#39;t over-complicate things without a good reason. Most teams treat merging as a pain and they\&#39;ve hard-earned that feeling.\n\nPoints to consider:\n\n\nRelease branches turn read-only once the version released (passed QA\nand had been green-lighted for delivery)\nBe restrained on creating new\nbranches. New branches should be created when absolutely required.\nReasons may be: major version, feature isolation, released customer\nversion, hotfix\\patch isolation\nPrefer labels instead of new branches when possible. Once a feature has been merged to the main\\trunk branch, label it and disallow further check-ins to it\nbranch\nAs a rule of thumb, only branches that are actively developed\non should be online. Avoid &quot;zombie&quot; branches by removing\nbranches that had been merged and inactive\nMerge frequently\nUse CI nightly builds as the first line of quality control\n\n\nYour scenario is possibly somewhere in between scenario #3 (Branching and Labeling) and #4 (Multi Feature Teams) in the TFS Branching Guide. However, complex development plans tend to diverse so be your own judge when choosing a new strategy.

Anypoint studio uses Maven to build its projects and handle versioning. Currently we are using a Git-flow branching model without release branches (feature/development/master) and the CI tool is Jenkins. We want to migrate to Azure-DevOps with Trunk-based branching.\n\nThe current git-flow CI set-up works as follows:\n\n\nMerge feature with Dev \nJenkins triggers on Dev and builds a package with Maven\nJenkins deploys the package to D\nTest your API on the D, if its good manually trigger Jenkins release pipeline\nJenkins will merge dev with master\nMaven creates a release; creating a package (e.g. v0.1) and prepare the next development iteration (v0.2-SNAPSHOT) in master\nJenkins Deploys the package on A and P\nMerge master back into Dev\n\n\nSo we have 2 separate pipelines here: dev and release. I&#39;m hoping trunk-based development makes this process simpler by reducing it to one pipeline that is triggered by merges into master. But I don&#39;t know how to handle the versioning with Maven here. \n\nThis is what I have in mind for the Trunk-based (feature/master) pipeline:\n\n\nMerge feature with Master\nAzure pipelines triggers Maven release\n(!)

I don&#39;t want to upload the entire site every time... is there any way to write a script that is smart enough to upload only what has changed to the web server when we execute it (don&#39;t want it to automatically be uploading to the production enviroment, we want to execute it manually)?\n\nDoes my question even make sense? (new)&quot;, &quot;Basically, your issue is that you can&#39;t use subversion on the production server. What you need to do is keep, on a separate (ideally identically configured) server a copy of your production checkout, and copy that through whatever method to the production server. You could think of this as your staging server, actually, since it will also be useful for doing final tests on releases before rolling them out.\n\nAs far as the copy goes, if your provider supports rsync, you&#39;re set. If you have only FTP you&#39;ll have to find some method of doing the equivalant of rsync via FTP. This is not the first time anybody&#39;s had that need; a web search will help you out there. But if you can&#39;t find anything, drop me a note and I&#39;ll look around myself a little further.\n\nEDIT: Hope the author doesn&#39;t mind me adding this, but I think it belongs here. To do something approximately similar to rsync with ftp, look at weex http://weex.sourceforge.net/. Its a wrapper around command line ftp that uses a local mirror to keep track of whats on the remote server so that it can send only changed files. Works great for me. (new)&quot;, &quot;It doesn&#39;t sound like SVN plays well with FTP, but if you have http access, that may prove sufficient to push changes using svnsync.  That&#39;s how we push changes to our production severs -- we use svnsync to keep a read-only mirror of the repository available. (new)&quot;, &#39;I use the following solution. Just install the SVN client on your webserver, and attach this into a privately accessible url:\n\n &amp;lt;?php\n\n    // make sure you have a robot account that can\&#39;t commit ;) \n    $username = Settings::Load()-&amp;gt;Get(\&#39;svn\&#39;, \&#39;username\&#39;);\n    $password = Settings::Load()-&amp;gt;Get(\&#39;svn\&#39;, \&#39;password\&#39;);\n    $repos = Settings::Load()-&amp;gt;Get(\&#39;svn\&#39;, \&#39;repository\&#39;);\n\n    echo \&#39;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;updating from svn&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;\&#39;;\n    // for secutity, define an array of folders that you do want to be synced from svn. The rest should be skipped.\n    $svnfolders = array(    \&#39;includes/\&#39; ,\&#39;plugins/\&#39; ,\&#39;images/\&#39; ,\&#39;templates/\&#39;, \&#39;index.php\&#39; =&amp;gt; \&#39;index.php\&#39;);\n\n    if(!empty($_GET[\&#39;justthisone\&#39;]) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; array_search($_GET[\&#39;justthisone\&#39;], $svnfolders) !== false){ // you can also just update one of above by passing it to $_GET\n        $svnfiles = array($_GET[\&#39;justthisone\&#39;]);\n    }\n\n    foreach($svnfiles as $targetlocation)\n    {   \n        echo system(&quot;svn export --username={$username} --password {$password} {$repos}{$targetlocation} &quot;.dirname(__FILE__).&quot;/../{$targetlocation} --force&quot;);\n    }\n\n    die(&quot;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Done!&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&quot;); (new)&#39;, &quot;I&#39;m going to make an assumption here and say you are using a post-commit hook to do your merging/updating of your staging server. This may work, but I would strongly recommend you look into a Continuous Integration solution. The following are some that I am aware of:\n\n\nXinc - http://code.google.com/p/xinc/ (PHP Specific)\nCruiseControl - http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/ (Wildly popular.)\nPHP integration made possible with http://phpundercontrol.org/about.html\nHudson - [https://hudson.dev.java.net/] (Appears to be Java based, but allows for plugins/extensions) (new)&quot;, &#39;LFTP is capable of synchronizing directories over ftp. (new)&#39;, &quot;Just an idea:\n\nYou could hold a revision of your project on a host you have access to and where subversion is installed. This single revision reflects the production server&#39;s version. \nYou could now write a PHP script that makes this repository update over svn and then find all files that have been changed since the rep was updated. These files you can upload.\n\nSuch a script could look like this:\n\n$path = realpath( &#39;/path/to/production/mirror&#39; );\nchdir( $path );\n\n$start = time();\nshell_exec( &#39;svn co&#39; );\n\n$list = array();\n$i = new RecursiveIteratorIterator( new RecursiveDirectoryIterator( $path ), RecursiveIteratorIterator::SELF_FIRST );\n\nforeach( $i as $node )\n{\n\n    if ( $node-&amp;gt;isFile() &amp;amp;&amp;amp; $node-&amp;gt;getCTime() &amp;gt; $start )\n    {\n\n        $list[] = $node-&amp;gt;getPathname();\n\n    } \n\n    // directories should also be handled\n\n}\n\n$conn = ftp_connect( ... );\n\n// and so on\n\n\nJust as it came to my mind.

We do CI but not every coming goes to production, and we want to increment (change) the version once the code is shipped to the customer&#39;s environment.\n\nHow in the trunk bases development (in an idiomatic way) should I do a release? How you feel with release commits on master? I can see two approaches (I&#39;m using Java + Maven bit that&#39;s just tooling that should come in the way). \n\nApproach #1\n\n\n//version information in trunk: &#39;SNAPSHOT&#39; \ngit checkout -b release/1.11\n// update version on release branch and commit\n// build the complete project and release\ngit checkout master \n// continue with features \n\n\nApproach #2\n\n\n// version information in trunk: &#39;1.11-SNAPSHOT&#39;\ngit branch release/1.11\n// update version on the master branch to 1.12-SNAPSHOT&#39;\ngit checkout release/1.11\n// update version on release branch to &#39;1.11&#39; and commit\n// build the complete project and release\ngit checkout master \n// continue with features\n\n\nThe second approach leaves a single commit in the repository&#39;s history, which I&#39;m not sure how to feel about. The latter approach makes the code slightly more traceable and the release process a bit easier.  \n\nOn a side note, I don&#39;t much care about bugfixes, etc. We do release a new version. But if a hotfix is required, we plan to cherry-pick&quot;, &#39;Instead of creating release branches just to update the versions, treat every commit as releasable in true CI/CD fashion.\n\n\n// Version information in trunk: &quot;SNAPSHOT&quot;, never edited by the developers, it is only used when built locally\nOn every push to the trunk your CI tool builds and runs all tests and creates a releasable package. Before doing anything the CI tool substitutes the SNAPSHOT version to some unique version number (see below). This change of version is never commited, it is just used for building. For easy traceability the CI tool can add the unique version as a git tag pointing to the commit (This is not strictly required if the unique version number an be derived from git information as described below)\n\n\nThis way all you commits to the trunk are potential releases and no additional process except for noting down the unique version shipped to the customer needs to be done as part of a release.\n\nRegarding unique version numbers I usually let the CI tool subsitute the SNAPSHOT version to something like &amp;lt;git commit date&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;short git commit hash&amp;gt;, which has the benefits of\n\n\nBeing truly unique (thanks to the hash)\nBeing easily interpreted and compared by a human (thanks to the date)\nBeing reproduceable (thanks to using git information) (new)&#39;]</td><td class="s11" dir="ltr">[&#39;Small team&#39;, &#39;Use short-lived branches&#39;, &#39;Use tags for releases&#39;, &#39;Cherry-pick changes to release branches&#39;, &#39;Trunk always ready for release&#39;, &#39;Adopt CI/CD pipelines for automated integration and delivery&#39;, &#39;Automated build and tests always pass on the CI&#39;, &#39;Enable fast and continuous feedback (+)&#39;, &#39;Promote frequent and rapid integration (CI) (+)&#39;, &#39;Simplifies the development workflow (+)&#39;, &#39;Use a single shared trunk&#39;, &#39;CI tool substitutes version information at build time for traceable, unique, and reproducible releases without committing version changes (new)&#39;]</td></tr><tr style="height: 30px"><th id="1569038740R75" style="height: 30px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 30px">76</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Azure DevOps Roll back after promoting build to production</td><td class="s3" dir="ltr">53037494</td><td class="s4" dir="ltr"><a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53037494/azure-devops-roll-back-after-promoting-build-to-production">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53037494/azure-devops-roll-back-after-promoting-build-to-production</a></td><td class="s5" dir="ltr">YANLIŞ</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">[&#39;Azure DevOps Roll back after promoting build to production (new)&#39;, &#39;We are using trunk based development and we have dev sandbox and production environments in Azure DevOps.

If it doesn&#39;t, you&#39;ll revert to the code prior to the experiment—but you&#39;ll keep the experiment around for reference.\n\nYou have several options:\n\n\nYou can commit the experimental code and then either undo that commit or revert to a previous commit.\nYou can branch, even after the fact, and then either merge the experimental code (knowing that you will not have conflicts) or just ignore the branch and continue on the trunk.\nIf the experiment turned out to have no lasting merit, another option is to simply discard the changes.\n\n\nLet&#39;s leave collaboration and even a remote repository out. Consider the case of working on a solo project with only a local repository.\n\nAre git branches exactly what you need? Is there another facility in git that more closely matches this need?

Here we assume that you will not continue development on the trunk during the experiment.\n\nWhat is the workflow recommended in an R&amp;amp;D scenario such as the one described here? (new)&quot;, &quot;Yes: 2.\n\nGit branches are exactly what you need. Git is very good with everything regarding branches.\n\nIn git, branches are trivially lightweight. Branches are the main thing in git driving all the incredible power it has - compared to some other repository systems where branches are heavyweight, or afterthoughts, or not existant at all. Branches are never overkill. \n\nNever hesitate even for a second to create a new branch in git. The creation is instantaneous and takes zero resources. Keeping a branch around forever after you merged it back into master als has zero cost, since it is impossible to delete the actual history anyways as it is now part of master, i.e. of a branch you are very unlikely to delete. You can delete them of course, it will only remove the name and nothing of the actual history - useful if you get confused by too many branch names in your (G)UI.\n\nThe only cost a branch ever incurs is to keep the commits leading up to it alive, before you merge it back into master (or into another permanent branch, for that matter). So if you really happen to have a branch with incredibly large space usage that you certainly will not need ever again, then sure, delete it after a while. But really, I don&#39;t see this as a concern; unless you happen to commit large images or other binary files to it.

This includes all DB schema and web resources in that change set.\n\n\nEach CR directory will NOT contain any files that are not being modified in the change set.\nIn a team based environment, these change set directories would be branches in version control so all team members could see all open changes and also enable automated validation / CI.\nEach Change is named with a unique identifier like a date/timestamp or a formal change identifier in an issue tracker like Jira.\n\n\nWhen Deploying changes to dev, test or prod, the web directory can just be pushed over to the web server being tested by SCP/SFTP, sometimes using the cool WinSCP directory syncing tool.\n\nWhen production release is complete and validated, files can be copied / merged to Version Control Trunk and the CR folder moved to an archive for future reference.\n\n\nNow, I am now trying to get my head around how to maintain large web projects using Visual Studio whilst following my change set methodology and have hit a wall on how to make this work. It would be great to keep my changes separate but also be able to use Visual Studio to step through code to debug things when log based debugging is insufficient. The Web projects I am maintaining are massive.\nHas anybody come across the ability in Visual Studio to have a Web Project based on two separate directory structures like WEB_BASE (containing the entire website) and CR1234 (containing the actively development code) and have Visual Studio use files by the following order of precedence: Use any files from CR1234 first and then WEB_BASE second, ignoring the duplicates in WEB_BASE?\nAre there any other ways to keep track of the discrete changes required for change sets whilst using Visual Studio and minimizing the UI noise of scrolling through resources that you are not changing to find the files you are working on?

Because of this approach, we make extensive use of feature flags in our application code.\nWe frequently need to modify our company&#39;s shared design system, which consists of two interdependent packages:\n&amp;quot;@common-ui&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;4.45.0&amp;quot;,\n&amp;quot;@design-system-react&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;4.45.0&amp;quot;,\nWhere common-ui depends on design-system-react.\nOur approach\nTo avoid polluting the shared design system with feature flags specific to our team, we to implement a strategy using npm aliases. This allows us to:\n\nImport alpha versions of design system components\nToggle between old and new versions using feature flags\nDevelop multiple features in parallel using different alpha releases\n\nIn our package.json, I tried set up npm aliases like this:\n&amp;quot;dependencies&amp;quot;: {\n  &amp;quot;@common-ui&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;4.45.0&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;@design-system-react&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;4.45.0&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;@common-ui-alpha-telephone-field&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;npm:@common-ui@4.46.0-alpha.9&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;@design-system-react-alpha-telephone-field&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;npm:@design-system-react@4.46.0-alpha.9&amp;quot;\n}\n\nAnd overrides like this:\n&amp;quot;overrides&amp;quot;: {\n    &amp;quot;@common-ui-alpha-telephone-field&amp;quot;: {\n      &amp;quot;@design-system-react&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;npm:@design-system-react-alpha@4.46.0-alpha.9&amp;quot;\n    },\n    &amp;quot;@design-system-react-alpha-telephone-field&amp;quot;: {\n      &amp;quot;@design-system-react&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;npm:@design-system-react-alpha@4.46.0-alpha.9&amp;quot;\n    }\n  }\n\nThen in our code, we can conditionally render components:\n// Import standard component\nimport { StandardComponent } from &#39;common-ui&#39;;\n\n// Import alpha component\nimport { AlphaComponent } from &#39;common-ui-alpha-feature-name&#39;;\n\n// Use feature flag to conditionally render\nfunction MyComponent(props) {\n  return featureFlagEnabled \n    ? &amp;lt;AlphaComponent {...props} /&amp;gt; \n    : &amp;lt;StandardComponent {...props} /&amp;gt;;\n}\n\nThe problem\nWe need a way to tell npm:\n&amp;quot;For the alpha version of common-ui, specifically use the alpha version of design-system-react, but for the standard version of common-ui, use the standard version of design-system-react.&amp;quot;\n➜  admin-ui git:(refactor/telephone-field) ✗ npm i\nnpm error code ERESOLVE\nnpm error ERESOLVE unable to resolve dependency tree\nnpm error\nnpm error While resolving: admin-ui-customer@1.0.244\nnpm error Found: @design-system-react@4.45.0\nnpm error node_modules/@design-system-react\nnpm error   @design-system-react@&amp;quot;4.45.0&amp;quot; from the root project\nnpm error\nnpm error Could not resolve dependency:\nnpm error peer overridden @design-system-react@&amp;quot;4.46.0-alpha.9&amp;quot; (was &amp;quot;^4.46.0-alpha.9&amp;quot;) from @common-ui-alpha-telephone-field@4.46.0-alpha.9\nnpm error node_modules/@common-ui-alpha-telephone-field\nnpm error   @common-ui-alpha-telephone-field@&amp;quot;npm:common-ui@4.46.0-alpha.9&amp;quot; from the root project\nnpm error\nnpm error Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry\nnpm error this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps\nnpm error to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.\nnpm error\nnpm error\nnpm error For a full report see:\nnpm error /Users/c_amehme/.npm/_logs/2025-04-11T16_48_09_693Z-eresolve-report.txt\nnpm error A complete log of this run can be found in: /Users/c_amehme/.npm/_logs/2025-04-11T16_48_09_693Z-debug-0.log\n➜  admin-ui git:(refactor/telephone-field) ✗\n\n\nQuestion\nHow can we properly configure npm to use the alpha version of design-system-react only for our alpha version of common-ui, while keeping the standard dependencies intact?\nAny insights would be greatly appreciated!&quot;]</td><td class="s6" dir="ltr">[&#39;Trunk-Based Development is often unrealistic in open-source projects, where async collaboration, longer feature branches, minimal feature flag use, and community-driven reviews make daily main-branch merges impractical.&#39;, &#39;Use feature flags to safely integrate incomplete features&#39;, &#39;Use feature flags to decouple deployment from release&#39;, &#39;Support safe experimentation and rollback&#39;, &#39;Promote frequent and rapid integration (CI) (+)&#39;, &#39;Enable fast and continuous feedback (+)&#39;, &#39;Accelerate release cycles (+)&#39;, &#39;Deploy frequently and provide fast feedback&#39;, &#39;Use of npm package aliasing to enable parallel development and integration of experimental features within a trunk-based workflow (new)&#39;]</td></tr><tr style="height: 30px"><th id="1569038740R84" style="height: 30px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 30px">85</div></th><td class="s7" dir="ltr">Continuous Delivery with Jenkins: Deploy to production as manual step</td><td class="s8" dir="ltr">66980520</td><td class="s9" dir="ltr"><a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66980520/continuous-delivery-with-jenkins-deploy-to-production-as-manual-step">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66980520/continuous-delivery-with-jenkins-deploy-to-production-as-manual-step</a></td><td class="s10" dir="ltr">YANLIŞ</td><td class="s7" dir="ltr">[&#39;Continuous Delivery with Jenkins: Deploy to production as manual step (new)&#39;, &quot;We are doing trunk-based development.

I have an idea to replace this with something else, for the work we&#39;re doing with our Azure based data platform consisting of several different Azure products (with different code masses).\nTo support CI/CD and flexible collaboration, I do not want to have release branches and I do not ever want to merge a development typed collaboration branch to the main/master branch.\nMy idea is to have the &#39;master&#39; branch correspond to the code running in production, and to create a (basically forever living) collaboration branch named &#39;development&#39; based on master (or possibly a fork?). Then for the ongoing development work the developers would create a feature branch based on master, that will be merged with pull request into the development branch once the feature development is done and the code should be deployed to DEV/TEST environment. Once the feature has been tested, the same feature branch will merged with another pull request into the master branch, for deployment to production.\nI can see one obvious downside with this branching strategy, which is that merge conflicts would have to be solved two times. Once when merging to the development branch, and again when merging to master.\nAre there any other downsides with this type of branching strategy?&quot;, &#39;Once the feature has been tested, the same feature branch will merged with another pull request into the master branch, for deployment to production.\n\nYes, exactly! You do not merge integration branches to other integration branches (branches like dev, release, main, ... where you integrate multiple feature branches together).\nMerging the same feature branch to different integration branches allows you to choose precisely the features ready to go to the next delivery stage.\nIntegration branches are long-lived branches you are merging to, not from.\nI have described that process before as gitworkflow (one word)\nThe downside is: what you are building in one branch is not exactly what you end up building in another, because you do not always chose the full set of feature branches merged in one integration branches when you are merging said feature in the other.\nThat means the artifact built from one integration is not always the same.\nBut as long as that artifact is still delivered across all the deployment environment (dev/test/pre-production/production), that should not matter.

(new)&#39;, &#39;My company is floating the idea of extending our version numbers another notch (e.g. from major.minor.servicepack to major.minor.servicepack.customerfix) to allow for customer specific fixes.\n\nThis strikes me as a bad idea on the surface as my experience is the more branching a product does (and I believe the customer fixes are branches of the code base) the more overhead, the more dilution of effort and ultimately the less productive the development group becomes.\n\nI\&#39;ve seen a lot of risk vs productivity discussions but just saying &quot;I think this is a bad idea&quot; isn\&#39;t quite sufficient. What literature is there about the real costs of becoming too risk averse and adopting a heavy, customer specific, source code branching, development model?\n\nA little clarification. I expect this model would mean the customer has control over what bug fixes go into their own private branch. I think they would rarely upgrade to the general trunk (it may not even exist in this model). I mean why would you if you could control your own private reality bubble? (new)&#39;, &quot;Can&#39;t help with literature, but customer-specific branching is a bad idea. Been there, done that. Debugging the stuff was pure hell, because of course you had to have all those customer-specific versions available to reproduce the error... some time later, the company had to do a complete rewrite of the application because the code base had become utterly unmaintainable. (Moving the customer-specific parts into configuration files so every customer was on the same code line.)\n\nDon&#39;t go there. (new)&quot;, &quot;I agree its generally the overhead to handle customer fixes is high, but I wouldn&#39;t say don&#39;t do it.\n\nI would say charge the customer an arm and a leg (and them some) if they want that much attention.  Otherwise don&#39;t do customer branches. (new)&quot;, &#39;In my travels I haven\&#39;t personally seen any definite literature for most of the good practices, although I suspect that there is a lot of stuff out there.\n\nVersions numbers provide a really simple mechanism to tie back specific versions in the wild with specific sets of code changes. Technically, it doesn\&#39;t matter how many levels are in the version number, so long as the developers are diligent in insuring that for every &quot;unique&quot; version released, there is a &quot;unique&quot; version number.\n\nLogic dictates that to limit support costs (which are huge, often worse then development ones), a reasonable organization would prefer to have the least number of &quot;unique&quot; versions running around in the field. One would be awesome, however there are usually quite a few in the real world. It\&#39;s a cost vs. convenience issue.\n\nUsually, the first number indicates that this series of releases is not backward compatible. The next number says that it mostly is, but a few things have changed and the last number says some stuff was fixed, but the documents all hold true. Used that way, you don\&#39;t need a fourth number, even if you\&#39;ve done some specific fixes at the request of a subset of your customers. The choice to become more client-driven shouldn\&#39;t have any effect on your numbering scheme (and thus it\&#39;s a bad idea). \n\nBranching based on customer requests is absolute madness. One main trunk is essential, so each time you branch it creates massive technical debt. Branch enough, and you can\&#39;t afford the interest anymore. (new)&#39;, &#39;You describe the changes that go into the customer branch as &quot;fixes&quot;.   Because they are fixes, I am assuming that they will also be made in the trunk and are really just advanced deliveries of future bug fixes.  If this is the case, why not just create a new &quot;servicepack&quot; (from question: major.minor.servicepack) and give that version to the customer.   \n\n\nFor example, you release version 1.2.3.  \nCustomer #1 needs a fix, create version 1.2.4 and give it to Customer #1.\nCustomer #2 needs a fix, crate version 1.2.5, give it to Customer #2 and advertise that they also get interim fix &quot;for free&quot;. (new)&#39;, &quot;Not sure about the literature but... if there is even a chance that you are supporting customer specific fixes it seems sensible to at least have a branching and versioning strategy in place.  Although I would be hoping for the strategy never to be used.\n\nI guess the danger is you end up with a culture where customer specific fixes become acceptible and the norm, rather than addressing the true issue that resulted in the need for the fix.  \n\nI guess the real cost will largely be dependent on whether its just an interim bug fix to keep a customer happy prior to the next release or whether its more of a one-off customisation.  If it is just the former, and the quantity isn&#39;t too high I wouldn&#39;t be too woried.  However if its customisations i would be scared witless. (new)&quot;, &#39;If you can find a way to compile your one product and turn on each client\&#39;s features on/off in their &quot;configuration&quot; of a central build that might be something worth figuring out.\n\nSomething like this might best be done through a profile/config/role based setup.\n\nYou may have to secure one set of client\&#39;s customizations from another, or maybe they can all benefit from it.  That part is up to you. \n\nThis way you can build custom views, custom codes, custom roles, custom code, whatever.  But, they\&#39;re a part of one project.  \n\nDo not maintain multiple codebases of the same product at any cost.  I did it once and doing an hour change takes at least 1 hour for each system if it\&#39;s in the worst spot.  It\&#39;s suicide.\n\nDo share what you end up doing! (new)&#39;, &#39;In my experience, the tipping point is reached when it becomes difficult to explain how bugfixes should be propagated through the branches.\n\nBranching hell is an issue because people lose track of what is in which branch. If propagation rules are too complex, people start making mistakes while propagating changes between branches, and that\&#39;s how you create branching hell.\n\nIf the &quot;Cisco&quot; branch raised a defect and we fix it, should we propagate the fix to the current release of the &quot;IBM&quot; branch, or only to the next release of the &quot;IBM&quot; branch? What if IBM raised the same defect? What if IBM doesn\&#39;t even use the feature that contains the defect? What if IBM later raises the same defect as high priority? With multiple customer branches propagation rules are never simple, so they pretty much guarantee branching hell.

There is common code that is constantly being checked into the main trunk and the code that is being checked into branch_uk,branch_us is dependent on the code that is checked into the main trunk.

I created a new branch based on that and switched my working copy over to this new branch.\n\nSince doing that another developer checked in some changes to the trunk, and I&#39;ve made some changes to the branch. I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve changed the same files so we should be good as far as any conflicts go.\n\nI want to merge my changes back into the trunk. \n\nI select merge, and then select merge a range of revision. URL to merge from i have the trunk selected. Range is blank. When i do a test merge it appears to be adding every file ever added into the project - it&#39;s certainly adding way more files then have been changes since i split off from the trunk. It&#39;s doing hundreds of files when there should just be 10 or 20 files changed. \n\nShould i instead select the range of revisions that the other developer checked in to trunk? Or should i instead be selecting &#39;merge two different trees&#39; ? If I try that and try doing a test merge from trunk to my branch i get a conflict. If i try doing from my branch to trunk, it looks like it works. Although I would then want to push everything back to trunk at that point since I&#39;ve made some fixes in my branch that i want to include in the trunk before I proceed with any more changes in the branch.\n\nedit: a little more detail to help clarity the current setup\n\nMy working copy was previously part of the trunk. I used tortoise to create a new branch and switched my working copy to that branch. So the project looks like:\n/project/branches/mybranch\n\ntrunk looks like\n/project/trunk\n\nAnother dev checked some changes into trunk, and i&#39;ve checked some changes into mybranch. I want to merge all those changes back into trunk before i do any more work on mybranch. When i view the log for mybranch, there&#39;s only 3 checkins; 153, 154 and 159 (and 153 is just the creation of the branch)\nwhen i view the log for trunk there are 4 since it was split from the trunk: 155-158\n\nThere should be no conflicts as we did not work on the same files.\n\nIf i try to merge FROM mybranch and do not specify a revision range, it appears to be adding every file in the project. i.e. i do a test merge and it&#39;s showing hundreds of files as added.\n\nIf I do a test merge FROM trunk and specify revision 155-158 that looks like it will merge all the changes from trunk into my working copy. I suppose if i do that i can then check everything into mybranch at which point i just need to figure out how to merge everything back into trunk.\n\nAll of the above was done using &#39;merge a range of revisions&#39;.\n\nIf i try doing &#39;merge two different trees&#39; and try merging FROM trunk to mybranch (with head revision) i get a conflict.\n\nIf i try merging FROM mybranch to trunk, it looks like it works.\n\nFrom what i have seen, it looks like doing the tree merge from mybranch to trunk is what i want to do. I&#39;m just not certain since so far i&#39;ve been told to do otherwise.\n\nI want everything pushed into trunk. I plan on making large changes to the code in mybranch which will break the project until it&#39;s finished, which is why i want trunk to be up to date before i start on that, in case i need to fix any existing code.\n\nedit2: when i do a merge range of revisions and select mybranch as the url to merge from, this is what shows up in the tortoise window as the command:\nCommand: Merging revisions 1-HEAD of /branches/mybranch into C:\\Users\\xxxx\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2010\\Projects\\MyProject, respecting ancestry, Test Only  \n\nMy working copy is already on mybranch. So to me this sounds like it&#39;s merging mybranch into my working copy, which is already part of mybranch, so basically it&#39;s merging mybranch into itself?\n\nMerging FROM trunk is the only thing that would make sense to me. And if do merge FROM trunk and select the revision range that the other dev checked in, the output seems correct. At that point then I would just need to then merge it all back into trunk.\n\nCommand: Merging revisions 154-158 of /trunk into C:\\Users\\XXX\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2010\\Projects\\myproject, respecting ancestry, Test Only  \n\nThe revision numbers that matter are:\n\ntrunk: 155-158 - these are the revisions the other dev checked into trunk\n\nmybranch: 153, 154 and 159. 153 is the creation of the branch. 154 and 159 are actual file changes that need to be merged into the trunk.\n\nThe other command i just tried which also seems like it will do what i want is if i merge from mybranch to trunk and specify revision 154 or 159 under FROM and revision 152 under TO (trunk). I&#39;ve never tried working with anything other then the current revision though so I&#39;m not exactly sure what happens if i merge with a revision a few numbers back. \n\nCommand: Merging from /branches/mybranch, revision 154 to /trunk, revision 152 into C:\\Users\\xxxx\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2010\\Projects\\myproject, respecting\n\nappreciate any help on clarifying the correct way to do this.\n\nThanks (new)&quot;]</td><td class="s6" dir="ltr">[&#39;Use a single shared trunk&#39;, &#39;Avoid big-bang merges&#39;, &#39;Reduce merge conflicts (+)&#39;]</td></tr><tr style="height: 30px"><th id="1569038740R90" style="height: 30px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 30px">91</div></th><td class="s7" dir="ltr">Is it possible to work on single branch with pessimistic approach?</td><td class="s8" dir="ltr">54182041</td><td class="s9" dir="ltr"><a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54182041/is-it-possible-to-work-on-single-branch-with-pessimistic-approach">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54182041/is-it-possible-to-work-on-single-branch-with-pessimistic-approach</a></td><td class="s10" dir="ltr">YANLIŞ</td><td class="s7" dir="ltr">[&#39;Is it possible to work on single branch with pessimistic approach?

If collaborative, I will push/pull the feature branch to the remote. \nWhen ready to integrate to master, I open a pull-request from my feature branch to master, so that the pull-requests is reviewed by peers &amp;amp; automatically assessed to know if the pull-request (the merge of my feature branch into master) passes the build and unit-tests. If the pull-request is &quot;green&quot; then my feature branch is automatically merged to master. \n\nI find the aforementioned workflow fine. However, in some internet posts, they advocate for a  &quot;trunk-based development&quot; (e.g.  1, 2).\n\nAs far as I am concerned, trunk-based development does not encourage developing into separate feature branches but all developers develop into master. This model, encourages that developers integrate daily (Martin Fowler\&#39;s CI practice) to the master to avoid conflicts (in contrast, what I would do is to rebase my feature branch on master). \n\nI was wondering which advantages this model would carry over the feature-based model. I have several doubts with the trunk-based model:\n\n\nHow would code-review be done? In feature-based model is easy: into the feature branch. In the trunk-based model, since all the commits are published in master, how can I make them reviewed? In fact, if I resolve conflicts when merging into master, wouldn\&#39;t this commits appear as to be reviewed (i wouldn\&#39;t like that)?\nHow would two developers collaborate on the same feature? In the\n    feature-based model, both would work on the feature branch. In the\n    trunk-based model, all developers would be collaborating in &quot;all the\n    features&quot; (somehow). Right?\nI believe, the trunk based model was &quot;created&quot; to avoid the problem of long-lived feature branches are their potential conflict hell when merging it to the mainline. However, if feature branches are short-lived, and if they are often rebased from the mainline, what is the issue then?\nOverall, which benefits can carry the trunk-based compared to the\n    feature-based workflow?\n\n\nThanks :-)&#39;, &#39;Your reference 1 already discuss some points about code-review. This answer is primarily based on my experience at work with the Gerrit tool and trunk-based workflow.\n\n\n  \n  How would code-review be done? In feature-based model is easy: into the feature branch. In the trunk-based model, since all the commits are published in master, how can I make them reviewed? In fact, if I resolve conflicts when merging into master, wouldn\&#39;t this commits appear as to be reviewed (i wouldn\&#39;t like that)?\n  \n\n\nThe code-review in trunk-based workflow ideally should be done before commits integrate into master. Manually, developers would push their commits to some temporary feature branch and, when approved, rebase those commits into master and push them (optionally squashing them into a single commit).\n\nGerrit automates this process. When pushing a commit to Gerrit, it creates an (almost invisible) temporary set of branches to hold the commit under review. During review, any corrections made are amended to the commit under review and pushed again to Gerrit. Once approved, the commits are integrated into master atomically (user can chose how among options like rebase, cherry-pick and merge).\n\nGerrit is best used for code-review in trunk-based workflow, since it promotes review commit-by-commit and the pushed commits only appear in master after passing review (corrections are done as amends, so &quot;wrong&quot; commits never go to master).\n\n\n  \n  How would two developers collaborate on the same feature? In the feature-based model, both would work on the feature branch. In the trunk-based model, all developers would be collaborating in &quot;all the features&quot; (somehow). Right?\n  \n\n\nRight. Since all features are developed in the same branch, all developers commits on that same branch. Code review (and continuous integration) will give some confidence that this branch is always sufficiently stable (at least for development, if not for production).\n\nThe drawback is that commits of different complex features become interleaved in the log - adding numbers of some issue tracking system helps a lot. However, squashing commits after code-review, or using Gerrit (which forces the reivew commit-by-commit, not branch-by-branch), experience has shown that most features are just a single commit (equivalent to the merge commit in a feature-based workflow).\n\n\n  \n  I believe, the trunk based model was &quot;created&quot; to avoid the problem of long-lived feature branches are their potential conflict hell when merging it to the mainline. However, if feature branches are short-lived, and if they are often rebased from the mainline, what is the issue then?\n  \n\n\nThe problem lies when some long-lived feature branch is integrated into the master. Then every other long-lived feature branch will have to integrate all changes from that finished feature all at once. That\&#39;s even worse if both the finished and the rebasing feature branches have done some refactoring.\n\n\n  \n  Overall, which benefits can carry the trunk-based compared to the feature-based workflow?\n  \n\n\nThe greatest benefits I have seen are:\n\n\nMore linear history, which is easier to understand and to make cherry-picks and reverts.\nSmaller conflict resolutions, mainly in case of major refactorings.\n\n\nHowever, I\&#39;d like to recommend again using Gerrit (or some similar tool) to automate code-review process in trunk-based workflow instead of using a tool designed for reviewing pull-requests (feature-based workflow).&#39;, &#39;Like you, the developers here at Debitoor had some doubts with trunk based development. To overcome these problems, they came up with an innovative solution they call Koritsu. \n\nKōritsu is the Japanese word for efficiency, and the approach is designed to ensure developers never interrupt or block each other. Koritsu is fairly similar to short lived feature branches, except it lets the feature branches live for up to a week and automatically deploy every merge to trunk. \n\nDebitoor has been using Koritsu for several years for our website and mobile development. For us, its been been running smoothly without any issues. One thing is for sure: we are not going back to Trunk Based Development\n\nOur CTO Allan has written an article about the problems with Trunk Based Development and how Koristu is designed to fix them. The article also includes a video of a talk he gave on his innovative solution to Trunk Based Development, which explains everything in more detail.&#39;]</td><td class="s6" dir="ltr">[&#39;Use a single shared trunk&#39;, &#39;Commit frequently (daily)&#39;, &#39;Promote frequent and rapid integration (CI) (+)&#39;, &#39;Reduce merge conflicts (+)&#39;, &#39;Simplifies the development workflow (+)&#39;, &#39;Mandatory code review policy&#39;, &#39;Squashing commits into logical units&#39;, &#39;Automate code quality checks (linting, testing, analysis)&#39;, &#39;Automate test execution (unit, integration, e2e)&#39;, &#39;Automated build and tests always pass on the CI&#39;, &#39;Enable fast and continuous feedback (+)&#39;, &#39;Emphasis on shared code ownership&#39;]</td></tr><tr style="height: 30px"><th id="1569038740R94" style="height: 30px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 30px">95</div></th><td class="s7" dir="ltr">Google&amp;#39;s Trunk Based Development - Do you push code directly to release branch instead of trunk?</td><td class="s8" dir="ltr">63387805</td><td class="s9" dir="ltr"><a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63387805/googles-trunk-based-development-do-you-push-code-directly-to-release-branch-i">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63387805/googles-trunk-based-development-do-you-push-code-directly-to-release-branch-i</a></td><td class="s10" dir="ltr">YANLIŞ</td><td class="s7" dir="ltr">[&#39;Google&amp;#39;s Trunk Based Development - Do you push code directly to release branch instead of trunk?&#39;, &quot;I am studying Google&#39;s trunk based development\n\n\nIn trunk-based development, developers push code directly into trunk. Changes made in the release branches—snapshots of the code when it&#39;s ready to be released—are usually merged back to trunk (depicted by the downward arrows) as soon as possible. In this approach, there are cases where bug fixes must be cherry picked and merged into releases (depicted by the upward arrow), but these cases are not as frequent as the development of new features in trunk.\n\nIt states that\n\nchanges made in the release branches—snapshots of the code when it&#39;s ready to be released—are usually merged back to trunk (depicted by the downward arrows) as soon as possible\n\nI&#39;m confused because right before that it states that developers push code directly into trunk.\n\nHow is it that code would be pushed to a release branch if it is supposed to be pushed directly to trunk?\n\nWhy would bug fixes be cherry picked and merged into release branches it&#39;s implied that bug fixes are done in a release branch and that release branch is merged to master?\n\nAssuming code is not directly pushed to a release branch, why would the release branch be merged back into master/trunk if it was forked from master?&quot;, &quot;How is it that code would be pushed to a release branch if it is supposed to be pushed directly to trunk?\n\n\nThe goal of a release branch is to let you focus on preparing the software for release without having to worry about what&#39;s happening in trunk. While the rest of the team keeps working towards the next version by committing directly to trunk, you stabilize the snapshot that was chosen for release by fixing any remaining bugs in the release branch.\nDuring this stabilization process, you may find bugs that also exist in trunk. When that happens, you&#39;ll want to merge the release branch back to trunk to integrate those bug fixes.\n\n\nWhy would bug fixes be cherry picked and merged into release branches it&#39;s implied that bug fixes are done in a release branch and that release branch is merged to master?\n\n\nWhile you&#39;re working on stabilizing the software in the release branch, the rest of the team may find a bug in trunk that also exists in release. If that happens, you&#39;ll want to integrate the bug fix in the release—however, you can&#39;t just merge trunk into release, because that would bring along all the new stuff the team has been working on while you were preparing the release. So, instead, you cherry-pick just the commits that fix the bug and nothing more.\n\n\nAssuming code is not directly pushed to a release branch, why would the release branch be merged back into master/trunk if it was forked from master?\n\n\nSee answer number 1. Note that merging a release branch back to trunk may lead to a lot of merge conflicts if the code in trunk is too far ahead from what was originally chosen for the release. For example, you may have fixed a bug in release, but the modified files are no longer in trunk due to a refactoring.\nIt&#39;s also worth mentioning that release branches are not always worth the additional overhead. The document you linked to offers an example:\n\nIn cases where releases happen multiple times a day, release branches are not required at all, because changes can be pushed directly into master and deployed from there.\n\nThe goal of trunk-based development is to simplify the process of developing software by reducing the number of branches you have to maintain to just a single one.&quot;, &quot;My experience shows that long-lived branches are evil. Be it feature branch or release branch. Every commit to the main is a candidate to get to the production.\nHaving a single main branch building for both development purposes and as a candidate for the release, including hotfixes, should be sufficient in case if there is robust test harness capturing all desired functional and non-functional requirements on the way of a commit to production.\nIt should be possible to use tags instead of branches and in exceptional cases create &amp;quot;release branches&amp;quot;, after production deployment has succeeded from the main, from a given tag. This should be really rare and discouraged and applicable in exceptional situations only.\nThe team must make sure that the main branch is always deployable and in a working state.\nEvery developer is free to choose the workflow and branching strategy locally as they find suitable. The single branch strategy applies to the central SCM repository only.\nThe developers must commit often. The test harness should catch breaking changes before they get promoted to main branch or (integration tests) further to QA/test stage.\nEvery team member is responsible for fixing merge conflicts in their PRs/MRs before submitting them to review for merging into main.\nIn case if there is a big redesign is coming, and with robust test harness as pre-requisite, a team can agree to &amp;quot;break the main branch&amp;quot; for limited period of time. (No big deal if we don&#39;t expect production ready releases in the next few days)\nIn case if there is a &amp;quot;big feature&amp;quot; requiring long time development, commit it to the main code base and disable it with a software switch. Commit all &amp;quot;big feature&amp;quot; development code, even intermediate, to the main branch at all times.\nThe stages higher than Dev operate with versioned binary artifacts built from the main branch. Their lifecycle and schedule can be controlled by the QA/test team.\nTo scale the process, e.g. when the team grows and commits become too frequent to maintain main branch stability, the project gets broken into dependent versioned modules. Each module receives its own CI/CD pipeline and its releases (from respective single main branch) get referenced in the higher/bigger  components. (This is how micro-service approach helps scaling development teams).\nThe big pre-requisite for the above approach to work is presence of robust test harness at various levels starting from unit tests and up to integration, load tests, etc. Responsibility for creating tests is within the single DevOps team developing the software component.

(new)&#39;, &#39;Back ground:\n\nWe are working out how we will control our SVN repository.  We are trying to workout a system that works in our daily business process.\n\nOur business is based around:\n  - T-SQL script files\n  - An in house scripting language\n  - business and form data loaded via .csv files\n  - We DO NOT &quot;compile&quot; code. \n\nWe have 4 developers that receive work orders to make changes to SQL or components commands, data load scripts, etc.  The developer will then make a work order branch to holds their changes from either Trunk (clean production scripts) or a DEV branch (represents our DEV environment for the combined changes for all work orders), this is yet to be decided. \n\nOur initial repository plan is something like:\n\nDev Branch (with all our recent changes)\nStage Branch (where we merge the work orders that are about to go to production)\nTrunk (a pristine representation of production) \n\nWe often have several work orders ongoing at the same time. So we would have several active branches. It is somewhat common for the same file to be changed in multiple work orders at the same time. \n\nThis makes things complicated for tracking the work order changes that get postponed while waiting for user approval.  Sometimes they are rejected and never go in!  We risk unintentionally promoting code from these postponed work orders if we branch from DEV. \n\nThe following example illustrates the concern from branching from DEV:\n\n\nday X\n\n1    WO1 branch - gets file version 1 (from DEV)\n2    WO2 branch - gets file version 1 (from DEV)\n3    WO2 merge back to DEV - file version 2\n4    WO3 branch - gets file version 2 (from DEV)\n5    WO1 merge back to DEV - file version 3\n6    WO3 merge back to DEV - file version 4\n\n\n\nNow we get approval to promote WO1 &amp;amp; WO3.  WO2 is lagging behind but we must move the others into production.  \n\nHere is the glitch.  How do I identify that WO3 has WO2 changes?  The DIF will show changes but that is to be expected.  We cannot install anything from WO2 as it would break our auditing requirements.\n\nIdeally we need to extract out the WO2 changes rework WO3.  Compounding the issue WO2 may need to be reworked depending on how long it lingers as well, I.E. later work orders change the file too.  Unfortunately we will have this issue with any work order using this file as long as WO2 remains outstanding.   \n\nOn the other side of the coin, If we branch from trunk we have some issues as well. \n\n\nWe are missing all the changes from other recent work orders using the same file(s). \nSo depending on how many changes have happen while we developed the work orders \nindependently or the changes while we wait to promote a work order could result \nin some serious merging issues.  Hypothetically, we could reduce that risk if we got\nthe branch from DEV which has the most recent changes that are merged to DEV. \nSimilarly the developers need to keep their databases and environments up to date as \npossible. But if we are pulling from trunk it may not have database schema changes \nmade in ongoing work orders. Or dependent T-SQL scripts from ongoing work orders. \n\n\nBasically we are debating the benefits or costs of branching our work order changes from trunk (production) or DEV (a repository of production plus recent development changes.) \n\nWith the above info in mid does anyone have any advice for which way to go?

(new)&#39;, &#39;I have been having a problem merging a production revision (which required a manual merge to resolve conflicts with an earlier revision) back into the branch where it came from. Merge isn\&#39;t finding any conflicts and the auto-merge is mangling the merged file. Can anyone see what I am doing wrong? \n\nHere is the SVN setup where I work:\n\n\nTrunk is production code, it is auto-deployed to the webserver and can never have any errors or problems.\n&quot;Dev&quot; is a branch where everyone works on general bugfixes and most small development.\nThere are other branches for larger projects, eg &quot;project1&quot;. \nEvery day, Trunk (production) is merged into every single branch, including Dev.  This is because we want no one working on a code base that could be in any way different from our production code with the exception of the changes they\&#39;ve been making in that branch.  \n\n\n(I also welcome criticism of our SVN structure/procedures.)\n\nNote: This is for a large web application that has no concurrently maintained versions, it\&#39;s just running 24/7 and we constantly are modifying/updating it with bugfixes, new features, etc. \n\nWe used to be running into problems with merges daily, and have recently restructured our SVN practices to what I described above. It has seemed problem-free until this happened. \n\nWhen people have changes that are fully tested and ready to be deployed to production, they merge those revisions from their branch into production.  This often ends up resulting in back-merging of changes from trunk into the branch where they came from later in the day. I assume this could be where the problem is coming from, but it\&#39;s worked smoothly for weeks until today. \n\n\n\nHere are the full details of the situation I\&#39;m experiencing:\n\nA developer is working in Dev and has several revisions they\&#39;re ready to deploy to production (trunk), they switch to trunk, open the merge dialog, select their branch, cherry pick the few revisions they\&#39;re planning to deploy, and hit merge (with the default settings). Assuming no conflicts, they would normally commit to trunk (which auto-deploys to the webserver and goes live within seconds). In this case, there is a conflict. Someone else   has previously deployed a revision to trunk that modified one of the same files.  The developer manually merges the two revisions and tests the file, confirms it is working, and commits the merged changes to trunk. \n\nAt the end of the day, I merge trunk back into all of our branches to make sure that tomorrow everyone has the latest code and becomes aware of any conflicts sooner rather than later.  To do this I switch to each branch one at a time, open merge, select trunk, and select just the revisions that were committed today to merge. I run the merge with default settings, and commit the merged changes into the branch.  In this case, when I get to the Dev branch, and merge from trunk, I run into problems. Almost all of today\&#39;s changes in trunk actually came from the Dev branch, so nothing but property modifications get brought in, except for that one file that had the merge conflict when the developer attempted to deploy it. That file gets auto-merged. I open the file to see what it brought in, and the merge is horribly screwed up. It has duplicated some lines of code (resulting in code errors), and placed others out of order, etc.  \n\n\n\nIt should also be noted that some of our team uses AnkhSVN in Visual Studio, while I and some others use nothing but TortoiseSVN. (new)&#39;, &#39;It\&#39;s possible that the developer needs to merge trunk into their branch before attempting to deploy their changes.  You say that you do this manually once per day, but it should happen before anyone attempts to deploy to trunk so they are fully up-to-date.\n\nIn my experience, I\&#39;ve found that before merging any branch to trunk it is a good idea to merge trunk to that branch first in order to work out the conflicts.\n\nI also generally don\&#39;t permanently work out of a branch.  My team usually does this:\n\n\nCreate a branch off of trunk to work on a particular task\nCommit the work to the branch\nCode review the branch\nFix anything found in code review and review again\nRepeat 3 and 4 as necessary\nMerge trunk into branch to get any completed work since branch and work out conflicts\nFinally, reintegrate branch into trunk\n\n\nAs a side note, I think in Git you can use a feature called &quot;rebase&quot; that will do the work you do every night (merging trunk into everyone\&#39;s branch).  I think it actually reorders the commits to make it like your branch actually branched after the new commits in trunk.  Might be worth looking into.

Feature branches did give us a good isolation in managing releases in a pretty granular way as to which features should go to release. However, the problems they posed (many branches, merge conflicts) were way more than the benefits they gave.\n\nWe work with Oracle database (with 5000 objects) at back end. We also have multiple teams working on different areas of the same product. We are using Visual Studio with TFS (no DVCS).\n\nThe more branches we create, more database instances we require to give proper  isolation in functional testing in those branches (each branch - one db instance) which are another set of problems. \n\nWe are adopting scrum and are searching for a branching model that will suit our release cycle (4 times a year) and CI builds. We are planning to do 5 regular sprint and 1 hardening sprint for each release. \n\nFrom a feature branching model, we reworked our branching model to a very simple branching like below -\n\n\n\nDevelopment branch is working as our &quot;Trunk&quot; (for Trunk Based Development) and ALL developers (all teams) are committing to this branch (for quarterly release), testers are testing in this branch and CI server (Jenkins) is building this branch daily. We just need a clean MAIN at any time for safety as &quot;Single Source of Truth for Last Release&quot; which come to our use often for several reasons.\n\nMaintenance branch is our bug fixing branch (hotfix) and is released several times during the year (irrespective of quarterly release). We prefer not to work directly on the main branch as want to have a &quot;clean&quot; Main branch. We do not want to let code go to Main without &quot;manual&quot; / functional testing done. Once a bug fix release is done, code is merged from Maintenance -&gt; Main -&gt; Development to integrate the bug fixes into Development.\n\nWe typically do not require the &quot;Release Branches&quot; as suggested in TBD since we will be continuously doing the bug fixes in the Maintenance branch, release from Maintenance and then merge the changes to Main (and then Development). We maintain only &quot;Last release&quot; and in case previous Release fix is required we create an old release branch from Labels in Main.\n\nHave we modified the Trunk Based Development to an extent that it would pose problems in future? What are your suggestions?\n\nRefer:\n\nhttp://paulhammant.com/2013/12/04/what_is_your_branching_model\n\nhttp://paulhammant.com/2013/04/05/what-is-trunk-based-development/#comment-2765204723&#39;, &quot;You should make a maintence branch from the tag that was released, only if you encounter a bug.

So, there will be one framework and more than one different applications built on that framework. Each application will have usual project cycle: builds, releases... Framework itself won&#39;t be released but may have tagged different versions. During the development of application, we want to commit some common features to the framework (if we see that feature is great and future applications should have it). \n\nSo each application is like a separate branch of framework, but it will never be fully merged back (because it&#39;s a separate application) and there is need do some commits to framework (trunk). Some online articles such commits (without merging whole branch to trunk) gives as negative examples, so we are confused.\n\nWhat version control system and branching model do you recommend for such development cycle?

Some online\n  articles such commits (without merging whole branch to trunk) gives as\n  negative examples, so we are confused.\n\n\nThis part scares me a bit. If you are going to have a framework, then you need to take care of it like any other lump of code, and you don\&#39;t want multiple versions running around for any reason except maintenance of existing releases or work on future releases. So each of your &quot;application&quot; projects can have a branch where they modify the framework as required for the application, but I recommend the framework trunk be updated often so that it evolves in a way that best serves the needs of all of your applications. In general, when  branching for code going forward, you want to sync up with the master and put code back into the master as quickly as possible to avoid lots of work handling merges and also give others the benefit of the work.\n\nYou should put your framework in a separate area (or repository if you are using a DVCS like git or hg) so that it\&#39;s distinct and may have its own release cycle if necessary.\n\nThe DVCSs are all the rage these days, git and hg being the most popular, so you should look into them. They have different ways of handling branching. Their power lies in the fact that there is no centralized repository so it\&#39;s more flexible and reliable for larger teams.

And above all I assume SvnFs would yield a read-only file system (if not, then I&#39;d not use it...), so what if your web server wants to create some files?\n\n(Hmmm, actually there&#39;s also Cascade for FUSE, which provides read-write access...)

We&#39;ve only moved to git in the last month and I&#39;m still learning.\nEdit\nJust to be clear, we have already have their source code with our changes.  So, I&#39;m not even sure what the best way to bring in their old source code where we have successfully already merged to so that we would have a common base.  Our code is to be the trunk and the trunk is to be our development branch.  We have already setup our system in this way and have some tools that are currently setup assuming this setup.  We also have more than just one library.\nOur current &amp;quot;process&amp;quot;, which was migrated from TFS, is to\n\nremove any deleted files (I guess I could delete them all, and only copy the  relevant .vcxproj and .vcxproj.filters files)\nadd new source/resource/other files\ndo a diff on the changes and cherry pick (manually copy and paste our code over to the new code) the additions we have made to move into the new code base.\nverify changes haven&#39;t broken things too badly and fix anything that has been broken.\nCheck in changes.\n\nOf course, step 3 is the most problematic, and I&#39;m hoping that doing this will simplify things as there would be a common ancestor.\nI&#39;ve written some scripts that will automatically stage files that don&#39;t have dany of our changes in them in an attempt to simplify this process.\nSecond thought\nAs rebasing appears to complicate things, perhaps I could just make a repository that only houses the 3rd-party library.  I would use that repository for only merging as suggested by @Mark Adelsberger answer.  Then I could just copy off the HEAD of that repository into our main repository.\nThis would mean that they would be two separate and distinct repositories with no linkage between them, but might be the best way to go. (new)&quot;, &#39;UPDATED based on discussion in comments.  A couple new notes about project structure before I get into it, though.\n\nIf you have commits prior to the first vendor source drop, that at least suggests the possibility that you have significant code files of your own, in addition to modified versions of vendor code.  That isn\&#39;t what I\&#39;d picked up from the original question.\n\nIf that\&#39;s the case, you may want to put the vendor code in a specific subdirectory (./vendor/), which was not reflected in the script I originally provided.  (If not, how will you avoid the possibility that they add a new file at a path/filename you\&#39;d been using for one of your files?)\n\nSo in any case, wherever I use the command\n\ncp -R /path/to/latest/source/drop/* .\n\n\nmy assumption is that the code is laid out &quot;correctly&quot; at /path/to/latest/source/drop.\n\n\n\nOriginal answer\n\nEvery time you rebase (or in any way rewrite) a branch, clean-up is required for every repo that already had a copy of that branch.  Since I would expect all of your dev team to have clones with the branches containing your local modifications to this source base, I do not recommend rebasing as a routine part of the workflow.\n\nInstead, just merge.\n\nThe sales pitch for rebase is that it produces a clean, linear history.  Sometimes that\&#39;s useful, though it usually has costs.  But in this case, it\&#39;s simply not plausible.  You cannot reasonably produce a single linear history containing your changes and those of another organization, wherein they don\&#39;t incorporate some of the changes you\&#39;re making on an ongoing basis, and you do get the changes they make on an ongoing basis.  (Heck, you can\&#39;t even control whether their changes come to you as a linear history to start with.)\n\nMore to the point, you\&#39;d spend a ton of unnecessary effort trying to do it, even if conditions line up just right and you somehow make it happen.\n\nWhat I would do is this:  Maintain your code using whatever branching strategy works for your team.  Add to that a &quot;vendor&quot; branch.  Your modifications should never affect the vendor branch, but you\&#39;ll merge from the vendor branch to your development branch (details perhaps varying based on your exact branching strategy).\n\nSo for example, suppose you have a dev branch that accumulates your work for the upcoming release.  You do an initial import of the vendor code, creating commit V1.  Then you branch from that to create your dev branch and start making changes.\n\nV1 &amp;lt;--(vendor)\n  \\\n   A -- B -- C &amp;lt;--(dev)\n\n\nNow some time goes by and you get another source drop from the vendor.  Check out the vendor branch, then replace the working version with the new source drop.  \n\n(The below assumes that there\&#39;s no reason for the vendor branch work tree to contain any files other than those provided by the vendor.  In practice you may find some things, like a .gitignore or .gitattributes file, to be useful; and in any case you need to make sure the .git directory isn\&#39;t deleted.  So you may want a more &quot;careful&quot; script in place of the rm command I show here...)\n\ngit checkout vendor\nrm -rf *\ncp -R /path/to/latest/source/drop/* .\ngit add .\ngit commit -m &quot;20xx-xx-xx source drop from $vendor&quot;\n\n\nyielding\n\nV1 -- V2 &amp;lt;--(vendor)\n  \\\n   A -- B -- C &amp;lt;--(dev)\n\n\nAnd now you can merge from vendor to dev.\n\ngit checkout dev\ngit merge vendor\n\n\nTo calculate the merge, git will figure out that V1 is the merge base, and will determine what\&#39;s changed on vendor since V1.  So you may get conflicts, and indeed this could get ugly since you presumably can\&#39;t prevent the vendor from doing wild refactoring on a whim, but it will be as easy as any other way.\n\nV1 ----------- V2 &amp;lt;--(vendor)\n  \\              \\ \n   A -- B -- C -- M&amp;lt;--(dev)\n\n\nThen this cycle just continues; you keep developing, and whenever you import Vn git will realize due to previous merges that V(n-1) is the merge base.\n\n\n\nUPDATE\n\nIn comments you mention that you already have a repo set up with some of your code in it.  That doesn\&#39;t prevent using the above approach, but it introduces some questions - because if your project is based on modification of vendor code, then what do versions before the first source drop look like?\n\nI see a couple things that could mean, so feel free to jump to whichever section best describes your situation (or, if none of these is right, please clarify):\n\nDoes it mean you just didn\&#39;t commit the original vendor code drop?\n\n(Update 2: Based on comments, it sounds like that\&#39;s the situation.  The first approach I suggested for this involves a history rewrite; you\&#39;ve stated that you don\&#39;t want to rewrite history.  That\&#39;s up to you, so here\&#39;s another alternative.  This creates a slightly &quot;weirder&quot; history, but is simple to execute and will work fine going forward.)\n\nAs with all the options I\&#39;ve posted, you start by creating a &quot;clean&quot; history for the vendor branch.\n\ngit checkout --orphan vendor\nrm -rf *\ncp -R /path/to/latest/source/drop/* .\ngit add .\ngit commit -m &quot;initial source drop from $vendor&quot;\n\n\nNow you\&#39;ll &quot;fake merge&quot; this into your existing dev branch, so that git will understand it as a merge base when you add future versions to the vendor branch.\n\ngit checkout dev\ngit merge --allow-unrelated-histories -s ours vendor\n\n\nThe -s ours specifies the &quot;ours&quot; merge strategy, which says &quot;don\&#39;t change the content I already have in the HEAD commit&quot;.  This will yield\n\n            V1 &amp;lt;--(vendor)\n              \\\nA -- B -- C -- M &amp;lt;--(dev)\n\n\nwhere M has the same &quot;content&quot; (TREE) as C, but recognizes V1 as a parent commit.  You can continue with the originally-described approach from here, as V1 will serve as the merge base when you bring in V2.\n\nIt\&#39;s worth noting that you should probably only use -s when the default merge strategy would create a merge conflict - which it would here, so no problem.  If the default merge strategy were able to resolve the merge, then using an alternative merge strategy creates an &quot;evil merge&quot;, in which changes (relative to both parents) are &quot;hidden&quot; in ways that can confuse both the user and some git commands.  For this purpose, it should be fine though.\n\nThat said, the claim that a rewrite would be &quot;risky&quot; is questionable for two reasons.  (1) You don\&#39;t have to replace origin until you\&#39;ve validated the result, so the organizational risk is zero; at worst it takes time (and so will any alternative).  (2) The type of merge approach you describe in comments has more moving parts, so is harder to reason about - which is why I say something might go wrong (but can\&#39;t really predict exactly what).  A rewrite is less familiar, but that\&#39;s not the same as &quot;riskier&quot;.\n\nWith that in mind, I\&#39;ve preserved the original rewrite approach here:\n\nCreate a second &quot;root&quot; commit in your repo.  Same caveats about the rm command apply as above.  \n\ngit checkout --orphan vendor\nrm -rf *\ncp -R /path/to/latest/source/drop/* .\ngit add .\ngit commit -m &quot;initial source drop from $vendor&quot;\n\n\nNow you have\n\nV1 &amp;lt;--(vendor)\n\nA -- B -- C &amp;lt;--(dev)\n\n\nSince I\&#39;m assuming at the moment that A already contains a modified version of the vendor code, you\&#39;d just want to re-parent A.  \n\nThis will be a history rewrite, but you need only do it once.  My recommended approach for this type of rewrite is to have everyone push all of their code to the shared remote, then discard their clones, then you do the rewrite, then everyone creates new clones.\n\nThe rewrite would be done using git filter-branch.  You\&#39;ll need to find the commit ID of V1.  You can get this from a command like\n\ngit log -n1 --format=%H vendor\n\n\nIt will be a 40-character string of hex digits.  Then the rewrite command would look something like\n\ngit filter-brnach --parent-filter  \&#39;sed &quot;s/^\\$/-p &amp;lt;commit-ID-from-above-command&amp;gt;/&quot;\&#39; -- dev\n\n\nIf you have multiple branches, then were I said dev you\&#39;d want to name all of your branches (except vendor).  If you have lots of branches, I guess you could use --all instead of typing it all out, but then you need a slightly more sophisticated --parent-filter to distinguish your root from the vendor root; see the git filter-branch docs in that case.\n\nIf your history contains tags, you\&#39;ll want them to move, so add a --tag-name-filter\n\ngit filter-brnach --parent-filter  \&#39;sed &quot;s/^\\$/-p &amp;lt;commit-ID-from-above-command&amp;gt;/&quot;\&#39; --tag-name-filter cat -- dev\n\n\nThe result of this would be\n\nV1 &amp;lt;--(vendor)\n  \\\n   A\&#39; -- B\&#39; -- C\&#39; &amp;lt;--(dev)\n\n\nwhere A\&#39; replaces A, etc.  The important point is that you have the &quot;pure&quot; vendor code on which A\&#39; was based to use as a merge base for the next vendor source drop.   From here everything works as I originally described.\n\nOr does it mean that you have your own code and are adding the vendor code to it?\n\nIn this case, your existing commits would contain no vendor code; so the fix is similar, but likely simpler.  There\&#39;s probably no need to do a rewrite.\n\n(You could do a rewrite, particularly if you want the vendor code to appear in the commits that already exist in your history.  But this would have to be done via rebase instead of reparenting, and that opens up a whole new can of worms.  If you can get by with the vendor code being added in after the initial history, it\&#39;s much simpler; if you need instructions on how to rewrite the vendor code into the existing history, let us know and we can add additional information.)\n\nYou\&#39;ll still want to create a &quot;clean&quot; history for the vendor branch.\n\ngit checkout --orphan vendor\nrm -rf *\ncp -R /path/to/latest/source/drop/* .\ngit add .\ngit commit -m &quot;initial source drop from $vendor&quot;\n\n\nBut now you\&#39;ll just merge this into your existing dev branch, so that you\&#39;ll have the vendor files from that point onward.\n\ngit checkout dev\ngit merge --allow-unrelated-histories vendor\n\n\nAs long as none of your files have the same path/filename as any vendor file, this merge will go smoothly, yielding\n\n            V1 &amp;lt;--(vendor)\n              \\\nA -- B -- C -- M &amp;lt;--(dev)\n\n\nand then you can continue with the originally-described approach from here, as V1 will serve as the merge base when you bring in V2.

Are there\nbenefits (or drawbacks) in having a\nspecial integration branch, then?\n\n\nthanks a lot. (new)&quot;, &#39;Why do you feel the need to do development in private branches?  Can\&#39;t you have your developers work together, in the same repository path?  The reason I ask is in my experience, most people that think they &quot;need&quot; this are usually wrong and don\&#39;t understand source management and how Subversion works.  I\&#39;m not accusing you of this but I am hoping you can explain the reasoning behind this requirement, as it might have an impact on future suggestions.\n\nTo attempt to answer your question, I can tell you that using private developer branches will add unnecessary burden to your administration and tooling configuration.  Developers should be working together in the same repository path, unless there is good reason like using a branch a bugfix release or experimental effort.  There are many reasons for this but the first few that come to mind for me are that development is a team effort, visibility into everyone\&#39;s changes, simplicity in development processes, simplicity in tooling configuration and simplified administration.\n\nTypical Subversion usage has the trunk be the path where all developers work on the next release.  You create branches to do isolated parallel development for things like bugfix releases, experimental features and long running development tasks for example.  We all know that all scenarios aren\&#39;t typical and each team\&#39;s needs are unique but until I know why you need private developer branches, I\&#39;m going to disagree that they are needed and that they will add unnecessary burden to your team, processes and tooling configuration. (new)&#39;, &#39;I would start with only a trunk branch with maintenance branches for releases if needed. That usually is a good default. This will generate surprisingly few conflicts and will drive development towards &quot;make small change often&quot; which is a good thing. I have experienced this with team size of 1-10 developers and it works. This is called &quot;release branches&quot; in Subversion doc.\n\nFeature branches is another common way to operate. Here you create a new branch for each new feature and merge features back to trunk. One developer might have several feature branch simultaneously or several developers might work on same feature branch at the same time.\n\nHaving a branch for each developer requires that you will make a lot of merges and they will be painful.\n\n\n\nTo answer your two unclear point: You should definitely make a new feature branch starting from the trunk after you have integrated the feature branch back to trunk. Subversion docs recommend to stop using old branch.\n\n\n  In Subversion 1.5, once a --reintegrate merge is done from branch to trunk, the branch is no longer usable for further work. It\&#39;s not able to correctly absorb new trunk changes, nor can it be properly reintegrated to trunk again. For this reason, if you want to keep working on your feature branch, we recommend destroying it and then re-creating it from the trunk:\n\n\nHowever there is nothing special about trunk branch, it is a normal branch in every fashion. It just has a different kind of name than other branches. Thus there is no special about reintegrating to trunk.

Due to the way the code is structured, for compilation purposes foo1 and foo2 needs to be in the same folder.\n\nShould I create another workspace with the following mapping?\n\n//depot/foo/trunk/... //my_client/trunk/foo/...\n//depot/foo1/branch1/... //my_client/branch1/foo1/...\n//depot/foo2/trunk/... //my_client/branch1/foo/...\n\n\nAnd switch to this workspace when I want to work on the branch. Note that foo is still pointing to //my_client/trunk/foo/\n\nMy development IDE is Intellij, so I&#39;ll create 2 projects. First project that has 3 modules for foo, foo1, foo2 in trunk. The second project will have the existing module foo for the trunk code, new modules for foo1 in branch1 and foo2 in trunk.\n\nI first tried to map all of this in one perforce workspace but soon found out that I cannot map the same location in the depot to 2 separate local locations in the same workspace. \n\nFor the project foo for which I&#39;m working on trunk and did not create a branch, I do not want to go through the whole project/Intellij module setup process and would like to reuse the existing local copy and setup.\n\nIs this the right way to approach this or is there a better way to do this? I&#39;m quite new to Perforce and still figuring out how it works. A similar scenario was quite easy to setup with Git.

This on the other hand would not work:\n\n//depot/foo/trunk/...    //my_client/trunk/foo/...\n//depot/foo/trunk/...    //my_client/branch1/foo/...\n//depot/foo1/trunk/...   //my_client/trunk/foo1/...\n//depot/foo1/branch1/... //my_client/branch1/foo1/...\n\n\nbecause one set of depot files is mapped to two locations -- but you said that you want &quot;foo&quot; to stay in its existing local location, so having two copies of it isn\&#39;t necessary (or desired) -- correct?\n\nIf you did want two different copies of foo (with a duplicate copy under the &quot;branch1&quot; local directory) then I\&#39;d do it by having two client views:\n\n//depot/foo/trunk/...    //my_trunk_client/trunk/foo/...\n//depot/foo1/trunk/...   //my_trunk_client/trunk/foo1/...\n\n\nand\n\n//depot/foo/trunk/...    //my_branch1_client/branch1/foo/...\n//depot/foo1/branch1/... //my_branch1_client/branch1/foo1/...\n\n\nNote that in the &quot;branch1&quot; client, the &quot;trunk&quot; depot path is mapped to the &quot;branch1&quot; client path, which is presumably what you\&#39;d want (again, if you just the &quot;trunk&quot; branch in the &quot;trunk&quot; local folder, you can do that within a single workspace).

I inherited this work flow, and I&#39;m trying to make it better.\n\nOur setup\n\n\nPHP code base (Kohana in particular)\ncode base powers ~60 sites, each with unique templates (i.e. 60 QA [Quality Assurance] domains too)\neach site has A-records for different assets and resources (i.e. 8 A-records for each domain)\n3 developers\n3 designers\ndevelopers have VMware image of production server for local development\ndesigners do not\nshared physical development server used for QA, a post-commit update keeps this server at the current HEAD of trunk at all times\nproduction server, updated to a mix and match of different revisions depending on what features are live\n\n\nOur Work flow\n\n\nDevelopers work locally until a given feature is complete and then commit the whole feature to trunk for internal QA.\nDesigners make small changes to CSS/images/templates only.  They commit directly to trunk, QA their own changes, and update the corresponding files on the production server, generally speaking, immediately after their QA.\nWhen features are ready to go live, the production server is manually updated to the proper revision numbers for each file related to the feature.  Sometimes this is simple, other times it&#39;s quite hairy (lots of svn log calls to look for upstream dependencies). \n\n\nOur problems\n\n\nWith three different developers working on different features that need different amounts of QA, we find ourselves running into upstream dependency issues on a regular basis.\nAt any given time, we don&#39;t have a way to programatically determine which features are on the production server and which are not.  svn status -u will show us which files are not up to date, but that&#39;s generally not a clear picture of features.\n\n\nWhat I know\n\n\nSome of our problems could be alleviated by having a production branch.  We could at least monitor which features were being added into production and when, although this wouldn&#39;t solve upstream dependency issues.\nFeature branches are an option, and we have tried that in the past.  Due to the fact that our software requires 60 QA domains per branch, we run into process management issues there.  For instance, the creation of 480 (60 domains x 8 records per domain) A-records for each feature branch.\nDeveloper branches are also an option, but our feature QA times vary.  I can&#39;t definitely say that a previous feature will be out of QA before I need to commit something else.\n\n\nUpstream Dependency Example\n\n\nDeveloper A adds a new slideshow feature in both the admin and front-end.\nDeveloper B adds a new feedback feature in both the admin and front-end.\nBoth of these features are intertwined with the Location model/controller logic, so changes are made to those associated files to account for both of the new features.\nThe slideshow feature enters QA, but is held up by some developmental oversight or scope creep.\nThe feedback feature enters QA and passes without issue.\nWe want to follow the timeline and push the feedback feature to production, but we cannot do it directly because both features required changes to the Location model/controller.  That is, we can&#39;t just do an svn update file1 file2 file3.\nNote: This is a simple example, and it can be worked around by doing some reverse merging.  Oftentimes our problems are complex than this.\n\n\nMulti-site Structure Information\n\n\nWe have a number of pre-defined structural themes, consisting of views, images, CSS files, JS files, etc.\nEach site is assigned a theme.\nFor branding and expandability reasons, each site can override a theme view with a custom view or include additional site-specific CSS/JS files.\n\n\nI&#39;m sure there are some other people out there that have struggled with similar issues, and I&#39;m hoping to get some insight from you smart people on the Internet.  Please feel free to ask questions if something I said seems clear as mud! (new)&quot;, &#39;OK, a couple of thoughts:\n\nFor this kind of workflow, you would do MUCH better with an SCM with a stream model, like Accurev or ClearCase.  In a stream model, the work flows from each developer\&#39;s streams to integration streams, then to QA streams, then to release streams (or whatever works best).  Only the work ready to advance to the next stage gets moved up, and integration can be done with those bundles of work alone.\n\nAs deceze said, you need to break things up more modularly, but you also need to combine it with a localization system where client-specific functionality can override specific parts of the code.  One way I\&#39;ve done that in PHP is by implementing a PHP file import wrapper that first looks for a client-specific version of a PHP file, and if it doesn\&#39;t exist, load the generic one instead.  \n\nfunction importModule($module, $clientId){\n   if(is_file(&quot;${clientRootDir}/${clientId}/${module}.php&quot;)) {\n      import(&quot;${clientRootDir}/${clientId}/${module}.php&quot;);\n   } else {\n      import(&quot;${defaultRootDir}/${module}.php&quot;);\n   }\n}\n\n\nUsing that technique, you can gracefully overwrite parts of the way the website works for just that client, and the person working on that functionality for that client is working in a completely different file so they don\&#39;t bump into each other.\nI\&#39;m not sure if you\&#39;re already doing this and that\&#39;s what you call your &quot;Location model&quot;\n\nLastly, with this many different &quot;virtual websites&quot; to test, you would benefit immensely with adding automated unit testing (a la PHPUnit) combined with continuous integration to automatically kick off tests when software works its way up to the integration stage. (new)&#39;, &quot;Your workflow can be improved, here is a list of my advice:\n\n\nStart using SVN branches and release builds/deployments on a regular cycle. \nFigure out how long your deployment cycle should be, leaving time in for QA. So for instance if you are going to release a build every month have 3 weeks of development and 1 week of QA. Freeze development for that build after 3 weeks except for bug fixes. \nDecide on a numbering scheme for your builds that allows room to grow\nUtilize a ticketing system (ActiveCollab, JIRA, Mantis ... etc) and enforce the rule that any commit has to be associated with a ticket. Pick one where you can make your commits show up automatically in the ticket. \nIf you are going to start to document your requirements before starting development, don&#39;t gather your requirements in the ticketing system (for gods sake)\nDoing this will help you determine what features are in a given build. So make some sort of release notes with a list of the ticket numbers or a general description of the tickets for each build. \nEmbed your build numbers in your application so that you can track deployments on any given system. \nStart working with automated testing tools PHPUnit for unit tests and Selenium for Functional tests to speed up QA and increase the quality/stability of the web application by decreasing the likelihood that day to day changes introduce new bugs.\nHudson and Phing can be lifesavers for automating your builds and automating your Testing.

I luckily still have my feature branch and it was never merged. It is based on the development branch, however my branch was taken fairly early on in the release cycle and was not updated by re-merging parent (trunk) changes - so my branch&#39;s parent is actually not too dissimilar from the new branch I need to apply it to.\n\nI know TFS has some facilities for re-parenting and baseless merges but what is likely to work best? More importantly if I try re-parenting, can I break my branch or am I safe that I can try things, back them out and try again if there are problems?\n\nMy branch is fairly large, maybe 50 changesets applied to quite a few separate modules.

(new)&#39;, &quot;Introduction\nI have a simple pyramid project for inventory management, and use git as my VCS. Switching away from git would not be hard, but switching away from pyramid would be. The scope of the project is quite small, meant for use by a single organization, with maybe 5-20 logins max at a time. The project is developed for A.\nProblem statement\nB also wants an inventory management software, and I wish to re-use what I&#39;ve already developed for A. There are certain fundamental differences (most importantly, the item models would differ as both A and B are interested in different attributes) as well as view differences (at the very least the logo on the page would differ, and B probably wants different pages based on their usage pattern, much more focused on keeping track of item loans where A is much more focused on ensuring timely delivery of items when purchase orders are sent to external suppliers).\nExample of fundamental differences\nBoth A and B would have models named Item and Group (Child-Parent relationship). However A would keep track of 5 attributes for Item (e.g. Brand, Part Number, Target Delivery Date, Actual Received Date, Description) while B would keep track of 4 attributes for Item (e.g. Identification Number, Description, Item type (consumable or re-usable), and Purchase Date).\nAlternatives considered\nHaving multiple branches off a single base (or a single submodule with common code) seems tough to keep synchronized/merged, mostly because I don&#39;t seem to have much &#39;common code&#39; in the sense of fixed directories or files which would not change at all between versions.\nBased on this talk - always ship trunk taken from the accepted answer to Workflow for maintaining different versions of a webapp using git? the recommendation is instead to maintain a single branch (trunk/master, obviously feature development is a separate branch) but version in-code with if/else checks on flags. However it seems more suited to multiple versions of the same web-app rather than two (slightly differing) web-apps as in my case.\nWhich of the above (or other alternatives) would involve the least maintenance burden, assuming both A and B&#39;s requirements don&#39;t significantly branch away from each other (e.g. A requests that financial accounting be included, at which point I would actually just fork a separate project)? (new)&quot;, &quot;I don&#39;t know Pyramid, but rather than using a VCS-oriented approach (ie. branches), what you probably want is a modular approach. Something like this:\n\nsiteA/\n    templates/\n    config/\n    assets/\n    tests/\nsiteB/\n    templates/\n    config/\n    assets/\n    tests/\nmodules/\n    inventory/\n    financial/\n    image_gallery/\n\n\nThe details of each site are kept separate from each other. They have their own templates, configuration, and assets (images, and whatnot) that describe how they behave and how they look.\n\nBits of functionality are developed as configurable modules. This is your inventory system, your financial system, an image gallery... whatever.\n\nThen siteA and siteB can individually choose which modules they want to use, configure how they act, and how they look.\n\nThe main advantage is that the details of the sites are decoupled from each other, so you can cater to the whims of your individual customers without changing how the other behaves. Someone can work on siteA without worrying about breaking siteB. Common functionality is put into the modules which have a more formal, documented interface.\n\nThe main disadvantage is that if A and B have a lot in common it can get redundant. There&#39;s various ways to mitigate that: push more common functionality into the modules, create shared templates, symlink to common templates and assets, improve the default configuration of modules, or even branches.

But in all my development experience, I\&#39;ve only ever really worked on trunk code. In a few rare cases, some other developer (who owned the repository) asked me to commit changes to a certain branch and I just did whatever he asked me to do. I consider &quot;merging&quot; a bizarre black art, and I\&#39;ve only ever attempted it under careful supervision.\n\nBut in this case, I\&#39;m responsible for the repository, and this kind of thing is totally new to me.\n\nThe vast majority of the code will be shared between all products, so I assume that code will always reside in trunk. I also assume I\&#39;ll have a branch for each version, with tags for release builds of each product.\n\nBut beyond that, I don\&#39;t know much, and I\&#39;m sure there are a thousand and one different ways to screw it up. If possible, I\&#39;d like to avoid screwing it up.\n\nFor example, let\&#39;s say I want to develop a new feature, for the pro and enterprise versions, but I want to exclude that feature from the demo version. How would I accomplish that?\n\nIn my day-to-day development, I also assume I need to switch my development snapshot from branch to branch (or back to trunk) as I work. What\&#39;s the best way to do that, in a way that minimizes confusion?\n\nWhat other strategies, guidelines, and tips do you guys suggest?\n\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nWell, all right then.\n\nLooks like branching is not the right strategy at all. So I\&#39;ve changed the title of the question to remove the &quot;branching&quot; focus, and I\&#39;m broadening the question.\n\nI suppose some of my other options are:\n\n1) I could always distribute the full version of the software, with all features, and use the license to selectively enable and disable features based on authorization in the license. If I took this route, I can imagine a rat\&#39;s nest of if/else blocks calling into a singleton &quot;license manager&quot; object of some sort. What\&#39;s the best way of avoiding code-spaghettiism in a case like this?\n\n2) I could use dependency injection. But generally, I hate it (since it moves logic from the source code into configuration files, which make the project more difficult to grok). And even then, I\&#39;m still distributing the full app and selecting features at runtime. If possible, I\&#39;d rather not distribute the enterprise version binaries to demo users.\n\n3) If my platform supported conditional compilation, I could use #IFDEF blocks and build flags to selectively include features. That\&#39;d work well for big, chunky features like whole GUI panels. But what about for smaller, cross-cutting concerts...like logging or statistical tracking, for example?\n\n4) I\&#39;m using ANT to build. Is there something like build-time dependency injection for ANT? (new)&#39;, &quot;Do you want to do this via Subversion ? I would use Subversion to maintain different releases (a branch per release e.g. v1.0, v2.0 etc.) but I would look at building different editions (trial/pro etc.) from the same codebase. \n\nThat way you&#39;re simply enabling or disabling various features via a build and you&#39;re not having to worry about synchronising different branches. If you use Subversion to manage different releases and different versions, I can see an explosion of branches/tags in the near future.\n\nFor switching, you can simply maintain a checked-out codebase, and use svn switch to checkout differing versions. It&#39;s a lot less time-consuming than performing new checkouts for each switch. (new)&quot;, &quot;A most interesting question.  I like the idea of distributing everything and then using a license key to enable and disable certain features.  You have a valid concern about it being a lot of work to go through the code and continue to check if the user is licensed for a certain feature.  It sounds a lot like you&#39;re working in java so what I would suggest is that you look into using an aspect weaver to insert the code for license checking at build time.  There is still a going to be one object into which all calls for license checking goes but it isn&#39;t as bad of a practice if you&#39;re using an aspect, I would say that it is good practice.  \n\nFor the most part you only need to read if something is licensed and you&#39;ll have a smallish number of components so the table could be kept in memory at all times and because it is just reads you shouldn&#39;t have too much trouble with threading.  \n\nAs an alternative you could distribute a number of jars, one for each component which is licensed and only allow loading the classes which are licensed.  You would have to tie into the class loader to achieve this. (new)&quot;, &quot;You are right not to jump on the branching and merging cart so fast. It&#39;s a PITA.\n\nThe only reason I would want to branch a subversion repository is if I want to share my code with another developer. For example, if you work on a feature together and it is not done yet, you should use a branch to communicate. Otherwise, I would stay on trunk as much as possible.\n\nI second the recommendation of Brian to differentiate the releases on build and not on the code base.

The three major containers are called Development, Integration, and Production.\n\nWithin the Development container\&#39;s Trunk, there are provisions for both the projects which make up the product in the Source folder, with corresponding unit tests available in the Tests folder.  A majority of minor development would occur in the trunk, with branching available through the Trunk folder\&#39;s sibling Branches folder, which acts as a branching container.  One or more solution files would live within the Trunk, allowing for branches at that level to capture the solution, source, and unit tests.\n\nThe Integration container, often called &quot;main&quot; in non-TFS implementation, is solely used to integrate Changesets from Development to create a stable and testable build.  It is initially created as a branch from the Development container once a testable product has been attained.  The builds from this container will be used for our testing environment and load testing environment.  We choose to include load testing with testable builds so that we can monitor for changes in performance, being able to rapidly isolate Changesets that may have contributed to any irregularities.\n\nProduction is used to produce pre-production and production quality builds.  It is initially created as a branch from the Integration container once a stable build has been recommended for release.  Within the Releases folder, a &quot;branch by release&quot; structure is followed, providing snapshotting and isolation in a single place.  (For example, when Release 1.1 is ready for a pre-production build, the stable Integration container is branched into a new Release 1.1 folder in the Production/Releases structure.  Subsequent RCs and RTWs/RTMs are promoted into this folder, as well.)  A branching structure is also present, as seen in the Branches container.  This allows for &quot;hotfixes&quot;, usually a revision marker (Major.Minor.Revision).  The branch is created from the current release and merged back into the new revision marker - like Release 1.1.1.  The Changeset would be reverse integrated to the Development container\&#39;s Trunk upon acceptance.\n\nWe feel that this structure is a fair balance between robustness and complexity.  But there are a few nagging questions that I can not logically fit into the model.  They are:\n\nTeam Build - The Development and Integration containers will initially start out as being nightly builds, eventually moving to Continuous Integration (CI).  The Production container will be manually built.\n\n\nWhere should the build definitions live? Edit - Based upon a couple of responses, the TeamBuildTypes folder has been moved to the trunk and branched to the appropriate containers.  This does, however, lead to a new question (follows).\nBy having the TeamBuildTypes folder in their appropriate containers, does that mean that all build definitions will be reproduced between the appropriate folders?  For example, having a build definition for development quality builds, as well as testable builds, etc. all living in all TeamBuildType folders throughout the structure.\n\n\nDocumentation Generation - We use Sandcastle to generate documentation.  Specifically, we also use Sandcastle Help File Builder to manage the output.  This produces a project file in a format specific to SFHB.\n\n\nShould generated documentation be stored in the source control structure?\nShould documentation be generated for each container, or does it only posses value for pre-production and production quality builds?\nTo preserve fast local build times, should documentation creation be owned by a build definition?\nWhere should the SHFB-specific files live?  My initial inkling is to put it as a peer to the Source and Tests folders. I agree with the recommondations that it be a peer to Source and Tests.  Diagram changed to reflect this change.\n\n\nThird Party Binaries\n\n\nShould binaries (controls, libraries, etc.) be stored in source control?\nIf so, should it be it\&#39;s own Team Project?\n\n\nGeneral Documentation - Non-generated documentation, such as requirements, design documents, test plans, etc. are not going to be reflected by a folder in the source control structure.  After some research and discussion with my developers and peers, using the built-in Documents folder in Team Explorer provides more benefit, since it mirrors the structure within the Team Project Portal and some (business) users do not need the additional complexity of learning the source control aspect of TFS.\n\n\n\nI will update the structure as I get answers to the questions to provide a clearer picture.  I also welcome any other comments related to potential changes.  If I have any other questions, I will make sure to modify this post.\n\nEdits:\n\n\nClarification.  Source and Tests folders do live under the Integration container, as well.\nBoth Micah and Josh brought up great points regarding third party binaries.  Question added regarding the issue.\nDocumentation generation can be slow.  Question added regarding whether documentation creation should be owned by a specific Team Build Type.\nAdded resolution related to non-generated documentation, such as requirements, design documents, test plans, etc.\nAdded resolution related to TeamBuildTypes folder for build defintions.\nBased upon various feedback, moved the TeamBuildTypes folder to the trunk / branch levels. (new)&#39;, &quot;I like your idea of putting the Sandcastle files as a peer to Source and Tests, I would add a documentation folder, that would then contain the sandcastle files, and optionally the actual documentation.\n\nThere are definetly differences of opinions and I&#39;m sure I will be downvoted for this (since I have been before). I would put the generated documentation in TFS for a couple of reasons:\n\n\nYour going to want your documentation with each release, and using TFS is an easy aproach to ensure your documentation stays in the correct place.\nUsing TFS to store it means everyone will know where to go get the documentation.\n\n\nOne thing I don&#39;t see which I always struggle with is where to third party dependancies, it might be that they belong down under the source so they are with each project although if you wanted to share them accross projects you could add a new top level node.\n\nEdit\n\nFor my binaries I usually end up with\n\n$/ThirdParty/Company/Product/Version/Src(optional)\n\nSo for example I have \n\n$/ThirdParty/\n      Microsoft/\n        EntLib/\n           3.1\n           4.0\n      ComponentArt/\n        WebUI/\n           2008.1/\n             Src\n\nI like to add the source, I&#39;ve had to patch CA&#39;s source which I hate to do but when a third party doesn&#39;t fix the bug you have to resort to this. (new)&quot;, &#39;Great layout and explanation. I\&#39;ve struggled with the exact same issues. I\&#39;ve wound up with a very similar structure. Mine varies slightly.\n\nDevelopment/\n   Trunk/\n      Binaries/  -- Shared libraries\n      Source/\n      Test/\n      Docs/      -- Documentation\nTeamBuildTypes/  -- Build definitions\n\n\n\nAdding the binaries folder allows you to have one location in the branch where all your projects can reference shared libraries\nWe put the documentation here so it can travel along with it\&#39;s specific branch. \nOur build definitions are at the development level since we can figure them in one location for all of the branches, but it could definitely be at the branch level which may make more sense.\n\n\n\n  Should binaries (controls, libraries,\n  etc.) be stored in source control? If so, should it be it\&#39;s own Team\n  Project?\n\n\nI think they should definitely be source controlled, but I don\&#39;t see any reason to put them in their own team project. One issue to be careful with is TFS for some reason treats binary files slightly different. I\&#39;ve had issues where I\&#39;ve updated the binaries in source control, but &quot;Getting Latest&quot; on other machines doesn\&#39;t cause update of the files. Sometimes you need to do &quot;Get Specific Version&quot; and check the &quot;Overwrite Unchanged Files&quot; option for that particular file. (new)&#39;, &quot;You should put your TeamBuilds folder under your trunk. This was impossible in TFS2005 but Microsoft fixed it for 2008...\n\nThe reason for this is that your build may change with newer version (for example: new packaging schemes, different testing etc.) which may make it incompatible with older maintenance releases. Thats why you should couple the team build with the code&#39;s version.\n\nThis way, lets say you release a 1.0 version and put it under the Releases folder. You&#39;ll be able to build it and issue patches while working on v2.0 in your Development trunk (which may require modifying the build) (new)&quot;, &#39;For your binaries - obviously the only binaries that should be under version control are &quot;third-party&quot; assemblies that you aren\&#39;t &quot;building&quot; as part of any automated build.  If you have your own libraries that you have their source under version control etc - you should look at various strategies for building and synchronizing etc.\n\nI then organize them like Josh - and then use branching to &quot;copy&quot; the binaries to an _ExternalReferences folder which is a peer to the .NET Project folders within the solution tree.  This is a very efficient way server side as TFS Version control only stores &quot;Deltas&quot; - so essentially every &quot;duplication&quot; of those binaries across many projects is essentially like a &quot;pointer&quot;. (new)&#39;, &quot;One thing I&#39;d recommend is to not use the default location for team builds and include it in the &#39;branchable&#39; level because as you branch for various reasons (say code promotions) you&#39;ll want your build scripts to be branched and synced with it. \n\nAlso a new and more scenario specific guide was just published as well at http://www.codeplex.com/TFSBranchingGuideII (new)&quot;]</td><td class="s11" dir="ltr">[&#39;Use a single shared trunk&#39;, &#39;Use short-lived branches&#39;, &#39;Keep trunk updated with release fixes&#39;, &#39;Cherry-pick changes to release branches&#39;, &#39;Promote frequent and rapid integration (CI) (+)&#39;, &#39;Adopt CI/CD pipelines for automated integration and delivery&#39;, &#39;Automate test execution (unit, integration, e2e)&#39;, &#39;Automate code quality checks (linting, testing, analysis)&#39;, &#39;Automated build and tests always pass on the CI&#39;, &#39;Enable fast and continuous feedback (+)&#39;, &#39;Trunk always ready for release&#39;, &#39;Reduce merge conflicts (+)&#39;, &#39;Simplifies the development workflow (+)&#39;]</td></tr><tr style="height: 30px"><th id="1569038740R121" style="height: 30px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 30px">122</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Best practices, building trunk against trunk?</td><td class="s3" dir="ltr">368669</td><td class="s4" dir="ltr"><a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/368669/best-practices-building-trunk-against-trunk">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/368669/best-practices-building-trunk-against-trunk</a></td><td class="s5" dir="ltr">YANLIŞ</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">[&#39;Best practices, building trunk against trunk? (new)&#39;, &quot;We have many projects that use a common base of shared components (dlls). \nCurrently the development build for each project links against dlls built from the trunk of the components. (ie trunk builds use the dlls from other trunk builds)\n\nWhen we do a release build, we have a script that goes through the project files and replaces the trunk references to specific numbered versions of the components (that are built from a tagged branch) \n\nI think this weakens the testing that we do during development because the project that I am actually working on is using diferent dlls to what the release build will be using. I would like to always develop against the numbered versions of the components and only ever update them when there is a specific need.\n\nHowever others in the team argue that unless we develop against trunk (and update to the newer versions of the components with each release) we will have the problem that (a) our products will hardly ever update to the newer version of the components then (b) when we do need to update it will be a huge task because the component source/interfaces will have changed so much.\n\nWhat practices do you follow, and why?\n\nEdit: Sorry all, I have just realised I have confused things by mentioning that there are several main products sharing components - although they share the components they don&#39;t run on the same PCs. My concern relates to the fact the because the components are likely to change with each release of a product (even though there was no specific requirement to update the component) that testing would miss some subtle change that was done in a component and not related to the specific work being done on the product. (new)&quot;, &#39;Hmm, I may be in a minority here, but this comes down to release management.\n\nDeveloping against the trunk of a set of shared components means, by definition, that the components are a &quot;moving target&quot; -- a developer using those shared components won\&#39;t necessarily know if a newly found defect or failure is due to the project code or the shared components, which leads to a loss of productivity, IMNSHO.\n\nThe &quot;shared components&quot; have a release cycle all their own.  Give your other developers a break and fix the version of the shared components that the projects are going to use and use tags, labels or branches to identify the shared component release.  On the next iteration for the projects, bump up to the latest &quot;stable&quot; or &quot;production&quot; build of the shared components.\n\nThere\&#39;s another &quot;smell&quot; here, if you\&#39;ll pardon the expression.  Having &quot;shared components&quot; whose &quot;source/interfaces will have changed so much&quot; between project releases sounds like the components aren\&#39;t so solid or shouldn\&#39;t necessarily be shared. \n\nSee also the answer to this question Shared components throughout all projects, is there a better alternative than svn:externals? (new)&#39;, &quot;You should have strong interfaces that rarely change, so changing versions shouldn&#39;t be that hard.\n\nSeparating the versions and working against specific versions will increase overhead when you need to change, but it should also encourage less interface changes overall, which will help in the long term. (new)&quot;, &quot;We develop against multiple branches and trunk simultaneously and we have chosen to build and test each branch with the code we&#39;ll be pushing out to production. I don&#39;t think it is safe any other way.\n\nBasically, if a developer is working on trunk, all they have to do is worry about building from trunk and committing code to trunk.\n\nAny developer working on a branch needs to build and test off that branch (there are multiple projects all branched/tagged the same build/release). When they commit changes to that branch, they must also merge those individual changes into trunk.\n\nWe expect all developers to be familiar with SCM (SVN) and to be capable of maintaining multiple branches of code. As a team we handle major framework shifts or huge code changes to minimize troublesome merging. (new)&quot;, &#39;Two things here.  First, I think you\&#39;re right; you want to build against the most current development versions, not against the old versions.  If you haven\&#39;t already, you will see a situation in which the build-for-release blows up and you have to do an all-nighter cleaning up the diffs.\n\nI\&#39;m personally a fan of the &quot;commit to trunk, release from branch&quot; model anyway.  All commits go to the trunk, overnight builds or CI builds are against the trunk, and people create branches freely.  When you have a trunk that meets acceptance criteria, tag a release candidate, BUT KEEP MAKING UPDATES TO THE TRUNK.  If you hae a long release cycle, then you might have changes for release n+1 being added to the trunk, but ideally you should just shorten your release cycle instead.  If there are changes to the trunk that shouldn\&#39;t be in the released version, AND you have a problem that requires changes, create a branch against the tagged version --- and make sure you merge any changes back to the trunk once you have an actual release. (new)&#39;, &quot;We are using the scons building system, and have our own file in the root directory which specifies what version of each library we&#39;re going to use when building the application.\n\nThat reduces the need to change version names in several locations like you mentioned. (new)&quot;, &#39;Whether (b) is a valid argument depends on how often your shared components change and by how much.  If they change often in your workplace, it might be a valid that you are &quot;forced&quot; to develop off the newest version.  Whether that in itself is a problem is a valid question.\n\nHowever, from your side of things, I don\&#39;t see how you can push code into production without it being tested against the shared components being used in production.  Do you do a second test cycle against the release build?  Do you just pray that nothing breaks?  Frankly, (b) can be reversed in these cases to support your point of view:  If the trunk is different enough from the most recent tagged branch, then that effort has to be made to ensure your app works properly with it.\n\nIf your shared components are tagged often enough, then your colleagues are probably right, and it\&#39;s easier to manage the incremental changes from the most recent tag to the trunk than it is to manage the change from arbitrary version X (determined at the last build) to arbitrary version Y (determined when you choose to upgrade).

Here is the story.\n\n1) Firstly, I am on my own to develop my project.

At the same time, I also use the same trunk to keep on my development.\n\nHere is the question\n\nBoth of us use tortoise svn to do the whole check in /out and all sorts of svn process, after some time, his code has been modified and so as mine. One day we try to merge both of our codes together (after some milestone changes have been done), but we face the following problems.\n\n1) Since my colleague and I are not interfere with each other (i.e. I don&#39;t modify his code and vice versa). I want to combine both my code and his code to one, but I can&#39;t seem to find anything similar to this in the merge option. How can we achieve this in tortoise SVN?\n\n2) My concept on the merge process is as follows  \n\n\nFirst I merge my latest branch back to trunk and commit the changes \nThen I tell my colleague to merge his code to the trunk \nHe will encounter conflicts, I need to sit down and solve with him \nFinally we commit the changes (with all conflicts solved)  \n\n\nWe again use the newly committed trunk as our branch base to continue our development, the process repeats and continues.\n\nSince step 3 requires significant time to perform, is there anyway to make the whole process more efficiently?\n\nThanks for all the advice!

(new)&#39;, &#39;I\&#39;m looking for process suggestions, and I\&#39;ve seen a few around the site. What I\&#39;d love to hear is what you specifically use at your company, or just you and your hobby projects. Any links to other websites talking about these topics is certainly welcome!\n\nSome questions to base an answer off of:\n\n\nHow do users report bugs/feature requests to you? What software do you use to keep track of them?\nHow do bugs/feature requests get turned into &quot;work&quot;? Do you plan the work? Do you have a schedule?\nDo you have specs and follow them? How detailed are they?\nDo you have a technical lead? What is their role? Do they do any programming themselves, or just architecture/mentoring?\nDo you unit test? How has it helped you? What would you say your coverage is?\nDo you code review? When working on a tight deadline, does code readability suffer? Do you plan to go back later and clean it up?\nDo you document? How much commenting do you or your company feel comfortable with? (Description of class, each method and inside methods? Or just tricky parts of the code?)\nWhat does your SCM flow look like? Do you use feature branches, tags? What does your &quot;trunk&quot; or &quot;master&quot; look like? Is it where new development happens, or the most stable part of your code base? (new)&#39;, &#39;For my (small) company:\n\n\nWe design the UI first.  This is absolutely critical for our designs, as a complex UI will almost immediately alienate potential buyers.  We prototype our designs on paper, then as we decide on specifics for the design, prepare the View and any appropriate Controller code for continuous interactive prototyping of our designs.\nAs we move towards an acceptable UI, we then write a paper spec for the workflow logic of the application.  Paper is cheap, and churning through designs guarantees that you\&#39;ve at least spent a small amount of time thinking about the implementation rather than coding blind.\nOur specs are kept in revision control along with our source.  If we decide on a change, or want to experiment, we branch the code, and IMMEDIATELY update the spec to detail what we\&#39;re trying to accomplish with this particular branch.  Unit tests for branches are not required; however, they are required for anything we want to incorporate back into trunk.  We\&#39;ve found this encourages experiments.\nSpecs are not holy, nor are they owned by any particular individual.  By committing the spec to the democratic environment of source control, we encourage  constant experimentation and revision - as long as it is documented so we aren\&#39;t saying &quot;WTF?&quot; later.\nOn a recent iPhone game (not yet published), we ended up with almost 500 branches, which later translated into nearly 20 different features, a huge number of concept simplifications (&quot;Tap to Cancel&quot; on the progress bar instead of a separate button), a number of rejected ideas, and 3 new projects.  The great thing is each and every idea was documented, so it was easy to visualize how the idea could change the product.\nAfter each major build (anything in trunk gets updated, with unit tests passing), we try to have at least 2 people test out the project.  Mostly, we try to find people who have little knowledge of computers, as we\&#39;ve found it\&#39;s far too easy to design complexity rather than simplicity.\nWe use DOxygen to generate our documentation.  We don\&#39;t really have auto generation incorporated into our build process yet, but we are working on it.\nWe do not code review.  If the unit test works, and the source doesn\&#39;t cause problems, it\&#39;s probably ok - but this is because we are able to rely on the quality of our programmers.  This probably would not work in all environments.\nUnit testing has been a god-send for our programming practices.  Since any new code can not be passed into trunk without appropriate unit tests, we have fairly good coverage with  our trunk, and moderate coverage in our branches.  However, it is no substitute for user testing - only a tool to aid in getting to that point.\nFor bug tracking, we use bugzilla.  We don\&#39;t like it, but it works for now.  We will probably soon either roll our own solution or migrate to FogBugz.  Our goal is to not release software until we reach a 0 known bugs status.  Because of this stance, our updates to our existing code packages are usually fairly minimal.\n\n\nSo, basically, our flow usually looks something like this:\n\n\nPaper UI Spec + Planning » Mental Testing » Step 1  \nView Code + Unit Tests » User Testing » Step 1 or 2  \nPaper Controller &amp;amp; Model Spec + Planning » Mental Testing » Step 2 or 3  \nModel &amp;amp; Controller Code + Unit Tests » User Testing » Step 3 or 4  \nBranched Idea » Spec » Coding (no unit tests) » Mental Testing » Rejection  \nBranched Idea » Spec » Coding (no unit tests) » Mental Testing » Acceptance » Unit Tests » Trunk » Step 2 or 4\nKnown Bugs » Bug Tracker » Bug Repair » Step 2 or 4\nFinished Product » Bug Reports » Step 2 or 4\n\n\nOur process is not perfect by any means, but a perfect process would also imply perfect humans and technology - and THAT\&#39;s not going to happen anytime soon.  The amount of paper we go through in planning is staggering - maybe it\&#39;s time for us to get a contract with Dunder Mifflin? (new)&#39;, &#39;I am not sure why this question was down voted. I think it\&#39;s a great question. It\&#39;s one thing to google search, and read some random websites which a lot of times are trying to sell you something rather than to be objective. And it\&#39;s another thing to ask SO crowd which are developers/IT Mangers to share their experiences, and what works or doesn\&#39;t work for their teams. \n\nNow that this point is out of the way. I am sure a lot of developers will point you towards &quot;Agile&quot; and/or Scrum, keep in mind that these terms are often used very loosely especially Agile. I am probably going to sound very controversial by saying this which is not my intention, but these methodologies are over-hyped, especially Scrum which is more of a product being marketed by Scrum consultants than &quot;real&quot; methodology. Having said that, at the end of a day, you got to use what works the best for you and your team, if it\&#39;s Agile/Scrum/XP or whatever, go for it. At the same time you need to be flexible about it, don\&#39;t become religious about any methodology, tool, or technology. If something is not working for you, or you can get more efficient by changing something, go for it.\n\nTo be more specific regarding your questions. Here\&#39;s the basic summary of techniques that have been working for me (a lot of these are common sense):\n\n\nOrganize all the documents, and emails pertaining to a specific project, and make it accessible to others through a central location (I use MS OneNote 2007 and Love it for all my documentation, progess, features, and bug tracking, etc.) \nAll meetings (which you should try to minimize) should be followed by action items where each item is assigned to a specific person. Any verbal agreement should be put into a written document. All documents added to the project site/repository. (MS OneNote in my case)\nBefore starting any new development, have a written document of what the system will be capable of doing (and what it wont do). Commit to it, but be flexible to business needs. How detailed the document should be? Detailed enough so that everyone understands what the final system will be capable of.  \nSchedules are good, but be realistic and honest to yourself and business users. The basic guideline that I use: release quality and usable software that lacks some features, rather than a buggy software with all the features. \nHave open lines of communication among your dev. team and between your developers and business groups, but at the end of a day, one person (or a few key people) should be responsible for making key decisions. \nUnit test where it makes sense. But DO NOT become obsessive about it. 100% code coverage != no bugs, and software works correctly according to the specs. \nDo have code standards, and code reviews. Commit to standards, but if it does not work for some situations allow for flexibility. \nComment your code especially hard to read/understand parts, but don\&#39;t make it into a novel.\nGo back and clean up you code if you already working on that class/method; implementing new feature, working on a bug fix etc. But don\&#39;t refactor it just for the sake of refactoring, unless you have nothing else to do and you\&#39;re bored.\nAnd the last and more important item:\nDo not become religious about any specific methodology or technology. Borrow the best aspects from each, and find the balance that works for you and your team. (new)&#39;, &#39;We use Trac as our bug/feature request tracking system\nTrac Tickets are reviewed, changed to be workable units and then assigned to a milestone\nThe trac tickets are our specs, containing mostly very sparse information which has to be talked over during the milestone\nNo, but our development team consists only of two members\nYes, we test, and yes, TDD has helped us very much. Coverage is at about 70 Percent (Cobertura)\nNo, we refactor when appropriate (during code changes)\nWe document only public methods and classes, our maximum line count is 40, so methods are usually so small to be self-describing (if there is such a thing ;-)\nsvn with trunk, rc and stable branches\n\n\ntrunk - Development of new features, bugfixing of older features\nrc - For in house testing, bugfixes are merged down from trunk\nstable - only bugfixing merged down from trunk or rc (new)&#39;, &quot;To give a better answer, my company&#39;s policy is to use XP as much as possible and to follow the principles and practices as outlined in the Agile manifesto.\n\nhttp://agilemanifesto.org/\n\nhttp://www.extremeprogramming.org/\n\nSo this includes things like story cards, test-driven development, pair programming, automated testing, continuous integration, one-click installs and so on.

The code base is composed from a common part (infrastructure and applications), and client projects (developed as plugins).\n\nThe repository layout looks like this:\n\n\nInfrastructure\nApp1\nApp2\nApp3\nproject-for-client-1\n\n\nApp1-plugin\nApp2-plugin\nConfiguration\n\nproject-for-client-2\n\n\nApp1-plugin\nApp2-plugin\nConfiguration\n\n\n\nA typical release for a client project includes the project data and every project that is used by it (e.g. Infrastructure).\n\nThe actual layout of each directory is -\n\n\nInfrastructure\n\n\nbranches\ntags\ntrunk\n\nproject-for-client-2\n\n\nbranches\ntags\ntrunk\n\n\n\nAnd the same goes for the rest of the projects.\n\nWe have several problems with the layout above:\n\n\nIt&#39;s hard to start a fresh development environment for a client project, since one has to checkout all of the involved projects (for example: Infrastructure, App1, App2, project-for-client-1).\nIt&#39;s hard to tag a release in a client projects, for the same reason as above.\nIn case a client project needs to change some common code (e.g. Infrastructure), we sometimes use a branch. It&#39;s hard to keep track which branches are used in projects.\n\n\nIs there any way in SVN to solve any of the above? I thought of using svn:externals in the client projects, but after reading this post I understand it might not be right choice. (new)&quot;, &#39;You could handle this with svn:externals. This is the url to a spot in an svn repo\nThis lets you pull in parts of a different repository (or the same one).  One way to use this is under project-for-client2, you add an svn:externals link to the branch of infrastructure you need, the branch of app1 you need, etc.  So when you check out project-for-client2, you get all of the correct pieces. \n\nThe svn:externals links are versioned along with everything else, so as project-for-client1 get tagged, branched, and updated the correct external branches will always get pulled in. (new)&#39;, &quot;Yeah, it sucks. We do the same thing, but I can&#39;t really think of a better layout.\n\nSo, what we have is a set of scripts that can automate everything subversion related. Each customer&#39;s project will contain a file called project.list, which contains all of the subversion projects/paths needed to build that customer. For example:\n\nInfrastructure/trunk\nLibraryA/trunk\nLibraryB/branches/foo\nCustomerC/trunk\n\n\nEach script then looks something like this:\n\nfor PROJ in $(cat project.list); do\n    # execute commands here\ndone\n\n\nWhere the commands might be a checkout, update or tag. It is a bit more complicated than that, but it does mean that everything is consistent, checking out, updating and tagging becomes a single command.\n\nAnd of course, we try to branch as little as possible, which is the most important suggestion I can possibly make. If we need to branch something, we will try to either work off of the trunk or the previously-tagged version of as many of the dependencies as possible. (new)&quot;, &#39;A suggestion is to change directory layout from\n\n\nInfrastructure \n\n\nbranches\ntags\ntrunk\n\nproject-for-client-1\n\n\nbranches\ntags\ntrunk\n\nproject-for-client-2\n\n\nbranches\ntags\ntrunk\n\n\n\nto\n\n\nbranches\n\n\nfeature-1\n\n\nInfrastructure\nproject-for-client-1\nproject-for-client-2\n\n\ntags\ntrunk\n\n\nInfrastructure\nproject-for-client-1\nproject-for-client-2\n\n\n\nThere are some problems with this layout too. Branches become massive, but at least it\&#39;s easier to tag specific places in your code. \n\nTo work with the code, one would simply checkout the trunk and work with that. Then you don\&#39;t need the scripts that check out all the different projects. They just refer to Infrastructure with &quot;../Infrastructure&quot;. Another problem with this layout is that you need to checkout several copies if you want to work on projects completely independently. Otherwise a change in Infrastructure for one project might cause another project not to compile until that is updated too.\n\nThis might make releases a little more cumbersome too, and separating the code for different projects. (new)&#39;, &quot;First, I don&#39;t agree that externals are evil. Although they aren&#39;t perfect.\n\nAt the moment you&#39;re doing multiple checkouts to build up a working copy. If you used externals it would do exactly this, but automatically and consistently each time.\n\nIf you point your externals to tags (and or specific revisions) within the target projects, you only need to tag the current project per release (as that tag would indicate exactly what external you were pointing to). You&#39;d also have a record within your project of exactly when you changed your externals references to use a new version of a particular library.\n\nExternals aren&#39;t a panacea - and as the post shows there can be problems. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s something better than externals, but I haven&#39;t found it yet (even conceptually). Certainly, the structure you&#39;re using can yield a great deal of information and control in your development process, using externals can add to that. However, the problems he had weren&#39;t fundamental corruption issues - a clean get would resolve everything, and are pretty rare (are you really unable to create a new branch of a library in your repo?).\n\nPoints to consider - using recursive externals. I&#39;m not sold on either the yes or no of this and tend to go with a pragmatic approach.\n\nConsider using piston as the article suggests, I&#39;ve not seen it in action so can&#39;t really comment, it may do the same job as externals in a better way. (new)&quot;, &quot;From my experience I think it&#39;s more useful to have a repository for each individual project. Otherwise you have the problems you say and furthermore, revision numbers change if other projects change which could be confusing.\n\nOnly when there&#39;s a relation between individual projects, such as software, hardware schematics, documentation, etc. We use a single repository so the revision number serves to get the whole pack to a known state.

Considering the size of the feature, development is likely to stretch for some more time after that with some back and forth between development and testing.\n\n\nEverything below has happened since the beginning of Feature A:\n\n\nFix B came up during , coded quickly, but testing takes a long time (depends on another busy team), not yet finished, not ready for production.\nFeature C is introduced. Quickly coded but results uncertain (may require multiple commits through time to reach the final version). Testing of current state in progress. Results may lead to code adjustements. Meant for production at a specific date in a few months, not before. \nFix D, quickly coded, is in testing and is very likely to be ready for production before Fix B and Feature C.\nFix E is more involved, might take a few days. Multiple commits are expected. Should be testable along the way. It\&#39;s unclear when this will be ready for production.\n\n\nWe might end up having to put Fix D in production, then Feature C, then Fix B... but maybe it\&#39;s going to be Fix D, then Fix B, then Fix E, then Feature C. And who knows, maybe Feature A will go smoother than expected and will have to be released before some of the other bits.\n\nHow would one deal with this many parallel developments in SVN and when deploying? I\&#39;d interested in what one would commit in which branches, what might end up in the trunk, and deployment steps when any of these is ready for production, knowing that in our environment we do not really feature-freeze anything and any fix or feature, if ready, is likely to be pushed to production (I\&#39;m not sure this is great either -- if you think this is the root of our deployment issues, do tell).\n\n\n\nThe context and current solution\n\nOur team uses three environments: development, test and production. We use a SVN repository for the  web application with the usual(?) structure: trunk, branches, tags.\n\nOur current method goes like this:\n\n\nDevelop on trunk unless it\&#39;s a big new feature. This includes quick bug fixes, quick changes and things that are invisible to users (updates to dev-only features).\nIf it\&#39;s a big feature (multiple days of work or very risky change), create a new branch and commit there until ready. Switch working copy back and forth between the branch and trunk as needed.\nWhen quick changes are ready for testing, we simply svn-update the working copy on the test environment (it points to trunk).\nWhen a big feature is ready for testing, we usually switch the test working copy to the branch temporarily. This doesn\&#39;t work well when two branches are to be tested at the same time.\nWhen things are tested and ready for production, the method has varied...\n\nProduction points to trunk and is simply svn-updated\nProduction is switched to a release tag\nProduction points to a production branch where trunk updates are merged with cherry-picking\n\n\n\nWhile this has worked for a while, the current situation makes it rather unmanageable. There are at least 3 different fixes that were committed to trunk but need to be tested before going to production. Since development and test working copies point at trunk, all the fixes are available for testing (no problem there). There are also 2 branches that need testing before going to production. With the current method, they would need to be merged into trunk which is problematic if they turn out not to be ready.\n\nA frequent situation is that bug fix A is ready for testing before bug fix B (and committed in that order in trunk) but bug fix B ends up tested first (client priority) and needs to go to production right away.\n\nOh and we don\&#39;t have test suites on this application because it\&#39;s a huge legacy codebase and there is not time alloted to creating tests. As such, committing to trunk &quot;when it\&#39;s done&quot; is mostly based on gut feeling. (new)&#39;, &quot;Sounds like you need to:\n\nA) introduce release/integration branches:\n\n\ncreate a branch for the &#39;next release&#39; from a trunk revision at which you are certain all changes at that point are ready for release.\ntest against the release branch\n&#39;hotfixes&#39; can bypass this branch (see below)\nnew features and trunk revisions can be merged or cherry pick merged into the release branch if required.\nonce tagged and released, reintegrate the branch with trunk and delete it.\n\n\nB) create Tags for fully tested releases\n\n\nOnce the release branch is prod ready, tag it, and svn switch production to the new tag\n\n\nC) create Hotfix branches for emergency fixes:\n\n\ncreate a hotfix branch off the most recent released tag.\ncommit the fix\ntag it (ensuring the label indicates the released version is still prior to that &#39;next release&#39;.

We will have one other branch called the &quot;CurrentRelease&quot; that at any given time contains the currently deployed code. Towards the end of the sprint, after we hit Code complete we merge trunk to CurrentRelease do the final rounds of verification and release. We will have CI jobs running on trunk and also on CurrentRelease branch .\nAs we see it now there is small transition window , between the time we merge from trunk to CurrentRelease and the day we actually release , in which CurrentRelease branch doesn\&#39;t exactly reflect the currently running code in production. Now if we were hit by an emergency bug in this time we , do not have a ready made branch wehre we can just go and check in the fix , run the CI and release. What could be a good solution for this ? \n  Should we actually have 2 CurrentRelease branches like a CurrentPreRelease and CurrentRelease.

(new)&#39;, &quot;I am currently enhancing the release process of our projects on Jenkins (1.430).\n\nCurrent release jobs\n\nToday, for one specific project, we have one job dedicated to the Release process.\nThe complete procedure is the following:\n\n\nThe developer who is in charge of the release changes manually the version of all the pom.xml files (in fact using mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=2.0) to get rid of the -SNAPSHOT.\nThen, he creates a tag in SVN (http://my-svn-repo/project/tags/V_2_0 for example).\nOnce this tag has been created, he logs on our Jenkins server, and starts a Release build.\nThis build will ask him which tag he wants to use for the build. The job is configured as a Parameterized build, with the parameter List Subversion tags.\nJenkins will then build the artifacts from this tag, and deploy them on our Nexus instance.\nOnce this is done, the developer set the pom.xml versions to the new development version (i.e. 2.1-SNAPSHOT).\n\n\nThe advantage of this method is that I have only Jenkins job, as the build will rely only on a tag.\n\nHowever, this procedure involves too many human interventiosns (changes of the pom.xml, commits, tags, etc.).\n\nNew release jobs\n\nNow, I use the Maven release plugin.\nI&#39;ve created a job that asks three information to the user who launches the build:\n\n\nthe version of the release (parameter releaseVersion of the release plugin);\nthe version of development, after the release (parameter developmentVersion of the release plugin);\nthe name of the tag (parameter tag of the release plugin).\n\n\nThis job works fine, except for one point: the job is based on the trunk or on a branch in SVN.\nThis means that if I have 2 branches (in addition to the trunk), I will need to create 3 release jobs: one per branch.\n\nOne idea to keep the best of the two worlds (i.e. using mvn release, but keeping 1 release job) it to add a build parameter that will ask the user for the path of the trunk / branch.\nSo instead of setting http://my-svn-repo/project/trunk (or http://my-svn-repo/project/branches/BRANCH_V1) in the job configuration, I will set http://my-svn-repo/project/$FROM_BRANCH, and ask the user to input the FROM_BRANCH parameter.\n\nThe problem with this solution is that the user will have to input either trunk or branches/BRANCH_Vx, which may lead to errors.\n\nIdeally, I would love to have a build parameter that let me the choice of the branch (including trunk), as the parameter List Subversion tags exist for the choice of tags...\n\nSo my question: is there a better way to configure one Jenkins job that can work on all the branches?\n\nThanks.\n\n\n\nEdit: I found the Validating String Jenkins plugin that can be interesting to ensure that the value defined by the user respects some regular expression. That is helpful in my case...

We have been working for quite sometime now without version control. The project has become quite large and complicated now and feel that it is time to use some sort of version control ( vc ). \n\nWe have been reading quite a lot about vc and have found several techniques that people have suggested. although it might be a perfect method for them. it does not effectively apply to our case.\n\nour application is split up into various modules and we have outsourced work to a few freelancers. freelancers work independently over front end or back end depending on their skill. The work has been happening over a Private Network so far and we would like to shift to an online system.\n\nNow the problem is that we cannot distribute the source code for the entire project to all developers. developers are only allowed to work on some common libraries and their respective modules.\n\nHence we cannot allow the entire project to be downloaded onto each developers Local machine. Thus we need to find a way for all developers to be working on the same branch OR on the trunk. to be able to access only certain sections of the code and on saves/commits be able to check how their changes have effected instantly.\n\nIs there a way the above task can be achieved ? for a web application ? using a version control like subversion?\n\nTo summarize, the features we are trying to implement are as follows.\n\n\nInstant effects on save/commit ( When each developer saves/commits they should be able to test the effects like normal through the browser instantly )\nLimited access ( Each developer can access only a specific part of the project and not the whole project. )\nOnline repository / Online copy - ( we are working on a VPN connection, and would like to have the website work on an online copy. so when a commit is made, the developer can view his changes online instead of the VPN  )\n\n\n\n\nafter a lot of searching online we were able to find the below possibilities. But not sure if it is the right way to go.\n\n\nFor instant effects --&gt; Entire system is checked out in a webroot folder ( eg. wamp/www/projectName ), a bat file is called to update the current system in the webroot, everytime a commit is made, by using the post-commit hook.\nLimited access --&gt; All development for all developers happen in the trunk OR a Development branch, developers can access their respective sections, lock it if needed and commit changes when they are ready to see its effects ( note still in dev branch ).\ntags are created whenever a stable release is created. these Tagged copies are never modified.\n\n\nIs such a configuration achievable using subversion or should we look at other open-source version control tools ? (new)&#39;, &quot;Trying to prevent devs from accessing the entire source tree seems a bit misguided to me. Is it company politics? Don&#39;t you trust your developers?\n\nIn any case..\n\nThe easiest way to achieve what you want would probably be to put each module into its own repository (svn, git, whatever). Then you can selectively choose who has access to which repo. (new)&quot;, &#39;Post-commit hook, which unconditionally &quot;do site&quot; is in a common not-so-good idea: developer can commit semi-finished code and even don\&#39;t think about testing it\nMake your Working Copy public, when site became public - not-so-good idea from the POV of security and IP. For SVN 1.7 to move WC-root outside web-root is much better idea\nIf modules are splitted to different directories, you can create repository per module and &quot;super-repository&quot;, which, with svn:externals, combine repositories in Project\nPath-access inside tree can be easy controlled (in http-repo) by authz_svn_module\nEnable creating private personal short-time branches for developers (&quot;shelves&quot;), it helps to avoid (with 1) huge messed up commits (new)&#39;, &#39;Firstly, I\&#39;d recommend reading the &quot;Continuous Delivery&quot; book (website here). It provides many examples for how to set up this kind of thing.\n\nSecondly, yes, SVN allows you to assign permissions on a folder level as well as repo level (but read the &quot;do you really want to do this&quot; section).\n\nThirdly, making sure developers have up to date copies is something you should instill by discipline - &quot;before starting work, and before committing, run svn update&quot;). Post-commit hooks have a nasty habit of breaking stuff, and you\&#39;re not preventing commits which break the build.\n\nFourthly, I\&#39;d consider setting up a continuous integration server (also described in the Continuous Delivery book). This makes sure you have a clean, working build whenever you put together the work of your developers.

Over the last few weeks I\&#39;ve been looking into the best way to \&#39;project manage\&#39; this (my actual code is fine). The application will have an initial release, providing basic functionality and a further release providing advanced functionality. I\&#39;ve never used SVN, Trac, Bug Tracking, Staging Servers or Deployment Tools so this is all pretty new to me.\n\nBased on what I\&#39;ve learnt over the past week, here is what I\&#39;m looking at having.\n\n4 x VPS with 128mb RAM (256 burstable) and 10gb HDD space.\n\nConfigured in the following configuration\n\n\ntools.ops.ourdomain.co.uk - server hosting SVN, Trac, and secure file storage for uploads and DNS (where the nameservers for  point)\ndevelopment.ops.ourdomain.co.uk - development environment to work on trunk version of software.

Should I drop my development server down to my local machine? Does it make sense to put the DNS on the tools server or not?\n\nSecondly, what\&#39;s the best development methodology for a single developer? I was going to plan out all the features first of all eg &quot;Authenticate a user&quot;, &quot;Logout a user&quot; and then create them as trac tickets. The actual \&#39;how\&#39; and \&#39;where\&#39; could then be worked out when I come to the task in question. Would it make more sense to plan out all the class methods (and general files) and then create tickets for these?\n\nThanks in advance. (new)&#39;, &quot;Here&#39;s some tips some loosely based on agile methods, which should be pretty good for one man teams, as they don&#39;t have much overhead compared to usefulness.\n\n\nMake a deployment script - a single command you can run to deploy the app. This way you can easily repeat the steps you do to deploy the app. This reduces chances of making a small mistake or forgetting a step when deploying to production or staging\nI&#39;ve found developing on my own PC is usually fastest for me. No network delays when working, familiarity with the OS and tools. In the end what matters is personal preference.\nIt would be a good idea to have a staging environment, preferably on same hardware/software as the final production environment. This will allow you to confirm everything works OK there, and can allow clients to test drive the changes.\nTry doing periodical releases, similar to Scrum sprints. Choose what features you want to complete for the next release. This makes it easier to concentrate on the most important features as you know what you need to do, and also makes it easier to display progress (Ok this release features A, B and C). Only choose new features for the current release if you finish the ones you chose. Tag each release in source control.\nFor the above, you may wish to use Trac to keep track of features, as you said. What tool or approach you use doesn&#39;t matter, as long as you have some kind of map or document about what you&#39;re doing.\nIf you are familiar with unit testing, you may want to consider using Test Driven Development. If not, it might be a good idea to start learning about unit tests\n\n\nAnd last but not least, make a schedule and stick to it. Otherwise your project may end up taking considerably longer than expected.\n\nI hope at least some of these help you avoid some mistakes I&#39;ve made earlier in my career =) (new)&quot;, &#39;If you can change it without too much cost, double or quadruple the RAM. I have a 256 MB (fixed) &quot;workbench&quot; VPS and have had trouble running Trac/Python, Apache2, one or two PHP applications, and a remote desktop connection at the same time (the box would just refuse to do anything and claim &quot;out of memory&quot;). This was a Windows Server 2003 VPS, Linux is probably a little more frugal overall but more RAM won\&#39;t hurt.\n\nAs for the planning, I\&#39;m not sure whether Trac tickets are the way to go for the first steps and basic development. They\&#39;re great for handling single issues, ideas and features but for the big picture (functional requirements, drafts on what is going to be solved how, feature lists), you may be better of with just an office document, UML diagrams, or whatever you use to collect ideas and build a structure with.

(new)&#39;, &quot;I&#39;m working on building a Magento site, and it&#39;s by far the most mammoth package I&#39;ve ever worked with. I&#39;ve decided to set up a proper development server and use Subversion for version control. I&#39;m running in to a couple roadblocks and need some help.\n\nWhat I&#39;ve done so far:\n\n\nSet up web hosting on a host that uses cPanel. My &#39;Live&#39; site (mysite.com) will reside in ~/public_html/.\nCreated a &#39;Development&#39; subdomain (dev.mysite.com) that points to ~/public_html/dev/.\nStarted a SVN repository inside ~/svn/. My repo contains folders branches | tags | trunk.\nImported a freshly untarred magento tarball (v.1.3.2.4) into my repo at trunk/magento.\nCreated two databases a. mysite_live and b. mysite_dev.\nChecked out the magento code from my repo into ~/public_html/dev/ (dev.mysite.com)\nRan the initial Magento Installer, which populated my mysite_dev Db and created some config files (app/etc/local.xml is the only one I know of - there may be others?).\n\n\nHere&#39;s where I&#39;m stuck:\n\nSo I&#39;ve got a fully functional Magento Install in my dev space. What I want to do now is get my live site deployed identical to my dev site, as a starting point. Because the config is different in the app/etc/local.xml file; plus Magento stores the value for {{base_url}} inside the database, it&#39;s not as easy as updating my svn trunk from my dev site, then exporting/importing the db.\n\nAs I get further down the road with this, I want for there to be a straightforward path to push everything on my dev site through SVN and to my live site, along with keeping the databases synced except for the value of {{base_url}}. I&#39;ve read a couple forum posts elsewhere that reference using svn:ignore to avoid certain environment-specific files and directories, but don&#39;t know how to get set up on my live site and ensure everything is properly synchronized.\n\nShould I just check out a copy of the base code from trunk/magentoo from my repo to my live site&#39;s space, then run an install, then set svn to ignore local.xml, and assume that they&#39;re identical except for local differences? \n\nAt this point I just don&#39;t know how to proceed, and am reluctant to make any guesses in case it&#39;ll result in having to wipe everything out and start over again in the near future.\n\nAs a side note - I also need to create a &#39;Demo&#39; branch of the code for another subdomain; to show to people as proof-of-concept. I&#39;ll probably just cross that bridge when I come to it. Maybe it&#39;ll all make sense by the time I get to that task.\n\ntl;dr version - how do I manage Magento development&amp;amp;live code&amp;amp;Db&#39;s with SVN?\n\nThanks to all for taking the time to read and reply! (new)&quot;, &quot;First thing to do is check in the installed version of the program. That way, the copy of the program in the repo is a working one that you can actually use. Then you will need to ignore some files and directories so that you can run the other environments. local.xml is a good example, but also set ignore on the following:\n\n/var/report/*\n/var/log/exception.log\n/var/log/system.log\n/var/locks/*\n/var/session/*\n/var/cache/*\n/var/tmp/*\n/media/tmp/*\n\n\nThere are probably others but this should give you a good start. If you think that you might make changes to local.xml (and you might), copy local.xml to local.xml.dist and check the .dist version into the repo. When you checkout onto your other sites you will still have to make the changes manually, but it will be easier to track.\n\nFor the database, a common practice is to do a mysqldump on the dev environment and keep that in the repository as well. \n\nmysqldump -u user -p database &amp;gt; mysqldump.sql\n\nYou&#39;ll have to enter your password for that one. Now the copy in the repo is a complete copy of the site. To set up another environment, you&#39;ll check out the entire code base and then import the MySQL file into the database.\n\nRemember that when you do this (and any time you update the database in the repo and then want to update the changes on other environments) you will need to change the {base_url} and {secure_url} in the database. I&#39;ve seen some environments where developers created scripts to accomplish this automatically.\n\nFinally, try to make all changes to your dev copy of the site, as it will help keep your database in sync. If you make changes on the live copy without at least also reflecting them in dev, you will probably accidentally overwrite them later with one of the dumps and then wonder where your functionality went.\n\nHope that helps. If you have other specific questions, let me know.\n\nThanks,\nJoe (new)&quot;, &quot;I realize this is not exactly what you asked for but just want to tell you about my setup because I think it&#39;s not practical to continue to sync the dev database to production once you go live. You&#39;re probably going to want to make changes to your dev database for testing which are not always easy to revert. Building your content (products, etc) in the live environment and occasionally copying the database back to development I find works very well.\n\nFor my project I have built my live environment by installing Magento from scratch and just checked out the directories from SVN at these points:\n\n/app/code/local/MyOrg\n/app/design/frontend/default/myorg\n/skin/frontend/default/myorg\n\n\nAny customizations you make should be in one of these directories.\n\nI manage this directory manually on the live server:\n\n/app/etc/modules\n\n\nYou only need to create a file there if you create a new module yourself. (new)&quot;, &#39;I wrote Module Manager specifically to solve these issues.\n\nI do not recommend versioning app/etc/local.xml so that each environment can have different database credentials, but I do recommend versioning everything else using modman. Also, I recommend having modman run a script that clears Magento\&#39;s cache and applies database updates such as the one found here.\n\nWhen used properly you can &quot;svn commit&quot; to your trunk and simply run &quot;modman update-all&quot; on your other environments (including live) to update. For a safer update on 1.4 you can run \n\ntouch maintenance.flag; sleep 2; modman update-all; rm maintenance.flag (new)&#39;, &quot;we&#39;re using different local.xml files. Naming is up to you but local.xml.qa or local.xml.live having enviroment specific connection string are recommended :-)\n\none note: magento processes all *.xml files in app/etc folder so be careful in naming (new)&quot;, &#39;Here is the bash script that helps to set svn:ignore property values for Magento project.

(new)&#39;, &#39;We have a suite of related products written in VB6, with some C# and VB.NET projects, and all the source is kept in a single Subversion repository.\n\nWe haven\&#39;t been using branches in Subversion (although we do tag releases now), and simply do all development in trunk, creating new releases when the trunk is stable enough. This causes no end of grief when we release a new version, issues are found with it, and we have already begun working on new features or major changes to the trunk. In the past, we would address this in one of two ways, depending on the severity of the issues and how stable we thought the trunk was:\n\n\nHurry to stabilize the trunk, fix the issues, and then release a maintenance update based on the HEAD revision, but this had the side effect of releases that fixed the bugs but introduced new issues because of half-finished features or bugfixes that were in trunk.\nMake customers wait until the next official release, which is usually a few months.\n\n\nWe want to change our policies to better deal with this situation. I was considering creating a &quot;maintenance branch&quot; in Subversion whenever I tag an official release. Then, new development would continue in trunk, and I can periodically merge specific fixes from trunk into the maintenance branch, and create a maintenance release when enough fixes are accumulated, while we continue to work on the next major update in parallel. I know we could also have a more stable trunk and create a branch for new updates instead, but keeping current development in trunk seems simpler to me.\n\nThe major problem is that while we can easily branch the source code from a release tag and recompile it to get the binaries for that release, I\&#39;m not sure how to handle the setup and installer projects. We use QSetup to create all of our setup programs, and right now when we need to modify a setup project, we just edit the project file in-place (all the setup projects and any dependencies that we don\&#39;t compile ourselves are stored on a separate server, and we make sure to always compile the setup projects on that machine only). However, since we may add or remove files to the setup as our code changes, there is no guarantee that today\&#39;s setup projects will work with yesterday\&#39;s source code.\n\nI was going to put all the QSetup projects in Subversion to deal with this, but I see some problems with this approach.\n\nI want the creation of setup programs to be as automated as possible, and at the very least, I want a separate build machine where I can build the release that I want (grabbing the code from Subversion first), grab the setup project for that release from Subversion, recompile the setup, and then copy the setup to another place on the network for QA testing and eventual release to customers.\n\nHowever, when someone needs to change a setup project (to add a new dependency that trunk now requires or to make other changes), there is a problem. If they treat it like a source file and check it out on their own machine to edit it, they won\&#39;t be able to add files to the project unless they first copy the files they need to add to the build machine (so they are available to other developers), then copy all the other dependencies from the build machine to their machine, making sure to match the folder structure exactly. The issue here is that QSetup uses absolute paths for any files added to a setup project. However, this means installing a bunch of setup dependencies onto development machines, which seems messy (and which could destabilize the development environment if someone accidentally runs the setup project on their machine).\n\nAlso, how do we manage third-party dependencies? For example, if the current maintenance branch used MSXML 3.0 and the trunk now requires MSXML 4.0, we can\&#39;t go back and create a maintenance release if we have already replaced the MSXML library on the build machine with the latest version (assuming both versions have the same filename). The only solution I can think is to either put all the third-party dependencies in Subversion along with the source code, or to make sure we put different library versions in separate folders (i.e. C:\\Setup\\Dependencies\\MSXML\\v3.0 and C:\\Setup\\Dependencies\\MSXML\\v4.0). Is one way &quot;better&quot; or more common than the other?\n\nAre there any best practices for dealing with this situation? Basically, if we release v2.0 of our software, we want to be able to release v2.0.1, v2.0.2, and v.2.0.3 while we work on v2.1, but the whole setup/installation project and setup dependency issue is making this more complicated than the typical &quot;just create a branch in Subversion and recompile as needed&quot; answer. (new)&#39;, &#39;To my understanding, the key is to get rid of absolute paths and &quot;well-known&quot; network locations. Don\&#39;t have them. Ever.\n\nWhere I work, we keep all the setup files, projects, dependencies - ALL of it - in the very same code repository where the main code is. This way, when we create a branch, all the setup stuff gets branched along with it, and gets preserved in the exact same form as it was at the moment of branching.\n\nThe only problem that I see here is that, as you mentioned, QSetup uses absolute paths. While I find this completely ridiculous, I understand that you probably will not consider switching to something more professional (we use NSIS, by the way).\n\nHowever, it seems to me that a relatively simple solution may be applied. I assume here that QSetup keeps its projects in some kind of text, human-understandable format (otherwise, it is just ridiculous beyond comprehension). As such, you can create a copy of your QSetup project file(s) and replace all your paths with relative ones, with some kind of a marker at the beginning, like so: %ROOT%\\Dependencies\\SomeDep.dll\n\nThen you can have your build script run a simple utility just before calling QSetup, which will create the &quot;real&quot; project file by replacing %ROOT% with the appropriate path, where the repository happens to be checked out.\n\nAfter implementing this, you may create a build on any machine - be it a designated build machine, or a development one, or something else.

I have defined the repository directory in accordance with the following structure:\n\n\\project  \n   \\trunk  \n   \\branches  \n      \\systest  \n      \\production\n   \\tags  \n      \\production_yyyymmdd\n\n\nMain development is committed to the trunk of the project, and development is performed based on Change Requests (CRs) from the client. For the moment, I am happy to exclude the problem of overlapping CRs (ie a file that is changed by more than on CR). My problem is how to manage the process of migrating only the file changes associated with a single CR from trunk to systest and from systest to production. The promotion process as I have it at the moment is (take migrating from systest to prod as an example):  \n\n\nCreate a tag &quot;production_yyyymmdd&quot; based on the current production branch (this is used to allow retrieving a particular \&#39;version\&#39; if you like)  \n&quot;Update&quot; from production to a local &quot;Migration&quot; location (eg C:\\Build\\ProjectName)  \n&quot;Merge&quot; selected changes from &quot;systest&quot; to local &quot;Migration&quot; location\n&quot;Commit&quot; changes back to production  \n\n\nThe problem I have is with step 3. How do I tell SVN which files to merge to the Migration location. I do not want to merge all changes from systest to prod (and I might not even want to merge all changes in a particular revision from systest to prod), only changes in specific files.  \n\nEdit: I should also clarify that all the repository access is being done from a Windows client. I\&#39;m not running commands on the SVN server. (For interest\&#39;s sake, the SVN server is running on Linux, but that makes no difference to the problem space I believe)\n\nCheers\nRichard (new)&#39;, &quot;Here&#39;s a cool library/tool that we use: Savana.  For each ticket, a developer will create a branch using Savana, and when ready promote this user branch back to trunk.  A similar approach could solve the problem you presented: you create a branch for any given task, and merge it back into your main trunk path when the time is right. (new)&quot;, &#39;The &quot;normal&quot; process (i.e. the one my shop follows) is to create a release branch and a tag copy for each release of the product. Any critical issues that occur in production are fixed in the production branch, merged back into the trunk, the product is re-released, and a new tag copy is made.\n\nMeanwhile, non-critical issues are developed against the trunk and rolled up into a periodic release. It is not a standard practice to re-release upon completion of each non-critical issue (CR in your case).\n\nIf you want to re-release upon completion of a certain CR, I think you should follow the pattern of feature branching. When you receive a CR that requires a production release, create a feature branch from the production release branch. When the changes are completed, merge the feature branch into the production branch and the trunk and release from the production branch.\n\nYou might also consider shortening your release cycle. Frequent releases mitigate the necessity to make changes to released code. The business can often tolerate waiting 6-8 weeks for a change to be implemented but not 6-8 months. (new)&#39;, &quot;Wow, this actually sounds like a nice sane promotion system you&#39;ve got here :)\n\nIn terms of tracking things, the simplest answer I have is to enforce a certain developer discipline - that is, only include 1 CR per commit.\n\nTortoise has support for the bugtraq properties which can help you here by ensuring that every commit comment includes at least one CR number - it may be a useful hint to tell developers that if they&#39;re including &gt;1 tracking number for the commit then they&#39;re probably doing it wrong (unless one fix really does do multiple things).\n\nSo this will let you merge from trunk to systemtest just with the CR&#39;s you want. You can even use the tortoise merge ui to see what revisions in trunk haven&#39;t been merged into systemtest yet. But of course now you&#39;re going to want to go from systemstest to production with similar granularity - which is what the question is about.\n\nThe problem as I see it is that a single revision in systemtest can consist of multiple trunk commits, and you may not want them all in to production just yet.\n\nI wonder if it might not be best to do the merge into production from trunk - instead of coming from systemtest. In theory it should be the same code - you&#39;ll be able to track what trunk revisions are in system test and what&#39;s in production.\n\nSo to be clear with that, you promote a revision from trunk to systemtest, test it, then if it&#39;s ok, promote the revision from trunk to production (you may have to start a clean production branch again).\n\nYou should be able to write some tools that use mergeinfo to confirm for you which revisions are in systemtest but which aren&#39;t in production. And using the bugtraq properties, you should also be able to tell which CR&#39;s are completely merged into either branch, and which have revisions still to go.\n\nIf you&#39;re going to want to start promoting less than a complete trunk commit into test and production, you&#39;re in a bit of trouble, especially if picking changes from the same file. You could right click on indiviudal files and merge in directly on the file level (and perhaps manually undo certain changes) but choosing the files and changes will be very manual work and you won&#39;t get any help from the tools. Also, you&#39;re tracking scripts start to get extremely comples.\n\nBe warned however, that by doing this there&#39;s a very real risk of code drift between system test and production. I&#39;d recommend regularly doing a diff between the branches and ensuring that you can account for all the differences. If the two branches have the same revisions merged from trunk, they should be identical, any differences should be because of revisions in test that aren&#39;t yet in production, and of course, there should never be a revision in production that isn&#39;t in test.

Now, after reading few articles and seeing it leads to infinite branching tree, I realized that it\&#39;s bad and want to fix it. But it\&#39;s not so easy as I expected. TFS allows merges only with parent branches (siblings merge isn\&#39;t possible).\n\nHere is the diagram of our current branches hierarchy:\n\n\nLooks weird, but it all started from small changes in latest release branch while trunk has been suspended in the middle of 3-month work. Then we made few internediate releases one based on previous one (up to 1.1.4). But when we started release 1.2.0, the story with trunk repeated and we must have suspend 1.2.0 and implement 1.1.5 hotfix.\n\nNow I faced the need of merging 1.1.5 changes into 1.2.0 branch which isn\&#39;t possible directly. I can only merge 1.1.5 with 1.1.4 which I wanted to avoid (who knows maybe we\&#39;ll need to implement 1.1.6 based on 1.1.4 tomorrow). But it seems I have no other way out. Still it will be possible to create 1.1.6 branch from non-latest revision of 1.1.4.\n\nIs it what I must do and isn\&#39;t there a better way out?\n\nAnd now comes big troubles and the main question. Eventually I\&#39;ll need to merge all changes into trunk. And 1.1.5-1.2.0 problem is just a miniature copy of that. That\&#39;s why I\&#39;m asking an optimal and least risky way to perform this merge.\n\nMy current plan is the following:\n\n\nCreate branch &quot;1.1.4 final&quot; with the latest stable released version.\nOptional: Create similar final branches for all previous numbered releases. Should I do it? Most likely I won\&#39;t need that versions in the future anymore.\nMerge 1.1.5 into 1.1.4\nMerge 1.1.4 into 1.2.0. There wasn\&#39;t much changes in 1.1.5, so I shouldn\&#39;t run into problems here.\nMerge 1.1.4 into 1.1.3, 1.1.2 and downto the release branch. Should I expect conflicts or problems here? I expect and hope not.\nMerge release into trunk. Most scary part =)\nStabilize code in trunk.\nNow it is time to create a better branching strategy... I\&#39;m very unsure about this part at the moment.\nCreate new &quot;stable&quot; (Main) branch from trunk\nReparent trunk to become child of stable. This solution is suggested in related question &quot;How to fix TFS incorrect branching&quot;\nShould I remove current &quot;release&quot; and &quot;R***&quot; branches, or leave them as garbage?\nFor next comming releases do not create separate branches - instead label the final revisions in stable branch. Actually &quot;stable&quot; branch will consist only of final release checkins.\nI\&#39;m NOT going to create the &quot;integration&quot; branch for QA of stable features - currently we all live in single active branch without problems.\nCreate &quot;alternate&quot; branch based on stable for paralel development in case we\&#39;ll need to once more suspend current work to make some urgent fix. Should I keep single alternate branch forever, or delete it once merged and create a new one (like R125) when again needed?\n\n\n\n\nThe idea of this change is to have fixed limited number of branches (ideally 2, at most 3-4).\n\nPlease share your thoughts and concerns on my strategy, or propose a better one. I\&#39;m asking because not sure it all will work as I expect, don\&#39;t know if it\&#39;s the easiest way, and the mistake cost is huge. (new)&#39;, &#39;Is it what I must do and isn\&#39;t there a better way out?\n\n\nI\&#39;d carefully perform a baseless merge of all the changes from the branches under release into trunk. I\&#39;d do this one branch at a time, and merge &quot;All changes up to a specific version&quot; and select all &quot;Latest Version&quot;. That will give you a trunk that contains all of the changes from your releases.\n\n\n  Should I expect conflicts or problems here?\n\n\nYou may get conflicts, but with a bit of care and some forensic investigation of the history, you can get the changes into your trunk.\n\nThe normal process when working on release branches (even those not directly related to trunk) is to check into the release branch, then to RI (reverse integration) merge the change back to trunk. Some people prefer to check into trunk first and then merge into the release branch to avoid the situation where trunk may get forgotten about. It\&#39;s six of one, half a dozen of the other IMO.\n\n\n  Should I remove current &quot;release&quot; and &quot;R***&quot; branches, or leave them as garbage?\n\n\nI don\&#39;t think it matters, you could move them into a folder called obsolete releases if you want to hide them, or just delete them - TFS deletes are soft.\n\n\n  Please share your thoughts and concerns on my strategy, or propose a better one\n\n\nI wouldn\&#39;t create a stable. Once I had everything in trunk I would be happy, the purpose of a trunk/Main branch is to be the stable releasable version of the code, if the developers cannot keep it that way (I\&#39;m not blaming them BTW), then working in feature branches and regularly FI merging into the feature branch is the best way.\n\nWhere you go next really depends on the process your company has for releases.\nOne option is to &quot;label&quot; trunk when you have a release you would like. \n\nStart -----L:R1-----C-&amp;gt;\n\n\nIf you then need to put in a bug fix before release, you can branch from the label:\n\nStart -----L:R1-----C-&amp;gt;\n           |    /\n     B:R1  |--C/\n\n\nCheck the change into the R1 branch (B:R1) and merge it back to trunk.\n\nThis gives you a branch for releases if needed, but not too deep structure, you may end up with many branches, but you can use folders to keep them organised.\n\nI hope this helps, in closing make sure you read the ALM Rangers branching guide - it covers the main TFVC branching strategies you are likely to need and when you should use them.\n\nAnd finally, my question to anyone who wants to make a branch is &quot;How will you release this code?&quot;, this helps me make branches to solve problems, instead of creating problems. If I don\&#39;t know how the code will be released, I don\&#39;t know the best way to structure the branches - I was once involved in a project with a hierarchy of 23 branches off Main, that all ended up coming together before been tested or released - we could have used one :).\n\nLast thing, if you have a VSOnline account or another Team Project Collection, you could try re-creating a simpler version of your problem and experimenting with solutions. (new)&#39;, &#39;Your merge stratigics looks ok to me but i will try to finish with three branches diagram.\n\nWe are using three branches Dev,Test,Release.\n\nmost of the builds are from dev and are labeled. (same as trunk at your diagram).\nThen we move it to qa and continue development.\nIf there is an issue \\bug and Dev branch is in future development we set test branch to the label and fix the issue on test branch and merge it to dev and again and take label.\nIf we have an issue with production we use the label on release branch fix the issue, label it and ofcourse merge it to dev.\nThis how it all done using three branches.\n\nOfcourse you can always use feature branches for long and defacult features. (new)&#39;, &#39;Finally, I preformed that merge! Thanks @DaveShaw for recommendations, I mostly used them. But want to publicate my invention which I believe significantly saved time.\n\nInstead of performing a baseless merge from R120 directly into trunk, I created an internediate branch dev, from the common root revision of R120 and trunk and preformed a baseless merge from R120 into dev. That generated more than 600 files with conflicts! But it was easy to resolve them - Take everything from the R120.\n\nThen, since branches dev and trunk have common root, I could merge them with regular merge (not baseless). That performed much-much better than a baseless one and generated only 11 files with conflicts and I could resolve them in only 1 day - all those were real conflicts needing manual resolution and code editing to merge. So that saved me time to distinguish real 11 conflicting files from 600 those which are not a real conflicts and can be resolved automatically.\n\nNext, I will stabilize both branches and switch their roles (it appeared that currently dev plays role of main (stable) and trunk is broken). So I decided to use branching strategy &quot;Development isolation&quot; which will evolve soon to &quot;Development, Feature and Release isolation&quot;.\n\nFor most of my remaining questions, @DaveShaw provided good explanative answers I have nothing to add to.

The problem comes when we are preparing the release for these projects: Because the are so many projects the manual changes are a pain so we decided to find an automated solution to solve the release process. \n\nThe prequisites are these:\nWe all agreed that the release policy from SVN perspective should be like that:\n- all development should be performed on SVN trunk, releases should be created and maintained on branches. Each performed release should automatically create a tag.\n\nThe policy from MAVEN perspective is like that:\n- before releasing a project, we first copy the trunk to a branch in order to have control over projects maintainance on the branched code. The versioning system we choose is: Major.Minor.BuildNumber-SNAPSHOT (e.g. 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT). When branching the code, we want to change the project version number by incrementing the MinorVersion (e.g trunk-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT will become 1.1.0-SNAPSHOT, and 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT will be copied and released on the new created branch)\n- when we decide that the project is mature enough in order to be released we are releasing it by using maven-release-plugin (mvn release:clean release:prepare release:perform) so that our project version will be transformed from Major.Minor.BuildVersion-SNAPSHOT (e.g. 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT) to Major.Minor.BuildVersion (e.g. 1.0.0), then will be prepared for the next development iteration like: Major.Minor.BuildVersion+1-SNAPSHOT (e.g. 1.0.1-SNAPSHOT)\n\nThe problems we are facing are related to projects versioning. \nSo, during the development phase on the trunk, all the projects are using the latest SNAPSHOT versions of their dependencies (mvn versions:use-latest-versions -DallowSnapshots=true -DupdateDependencies=true), but when we consider it\&#39;s time to start the release procedure and prepare to branch the code, there problems start:\nwe are start branching \n\n\nparent-pom \n\n(mvn -B release:clean release:branch -DbranchName=${project.artifactId}_${project.version} -Dusername=${username} -Dpassword=${passwd} -Dproject.rel.${groupId}:${projectId}=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT\n-Dproject.dev.${groupId}:${projectId}=1.1.0-SNAPSHOT) \n\n\ncopy project from trunk to new created branch, transform pom version on trunk from 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT to 1.1.0-SNAPSHOT\n\nnon-dependent projects \n\n(mvn -B release:clean release:branch -DbranchName=${project.artifactId}_${project.version} -Dusername=${username} -Dpassword=${passwd} -Dproject.rel.${groupId}:${projectId}=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT\n-Dproject.dev.${groupId}:${projectId}=1.1.0-SNAPSHOT versions:update-parent \n    -DallowSnapshots=true)\n\n\ncopy project from trunk to new created branch, \ntransform the trunk pom version 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT become 1.0.1-SNAPSHOT\nupdate parent-pom.version: 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT become 1.1.0-SNAPSHOT\n\ndependent projects: \n\n(mvn -B release:clean release:branch -DbranchName=${project.artifactId}_${project.version} -Dusername=${username} -Dpassword=${passwd} -Dproject.rel.${groupId}:${projectId}=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT\n-Dproject.dev.${groupId}:${projectId}=1.1.0-SNAPSHOT versions:update-parent \n    -DallowSnapshots=true versions:use-latest-versions -DallowSnapshots=true \n    -DupdateDependencies=true)\n\n\ncopy project from trunk to new created branch \ntransform pom version on trunk from 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT to 1.1.0-SNAPSHOT\nupdate parent-pom on trunk from 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT to 1.1.0-SNAPSHOT\nupdate the already branched dependency projects from 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT to 1.1.0-SNAPSHOT\n\n\n\nThe first problem here is that there is no way yet to have an argument to increase the MinorVersion when branch the project, the maven-release-plugin 2.2.2 does not increment the pom MinorVersion on trunk when branching, so that\&#39;s why we need to use -Dproject.rel.${groupId}:${projectId}=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT\n-Dproject.dev.${groupId}:${projectId}=1.1.0-SNAPSHOT arguments and change them manually for every project, so 200 times every time when we preapare for a new release.\n\nI\&#39;m wondering if it\&#39;s not a way to make all described procedure somehow in an automated fashion and to not need to perform all these changes manually all the time.\nWe\&#39;ve taking account even to modularize this product so that to colapse those 200 project in 100 probably, but this is not acceptable since the idea is to have a fine grained projects versioning and have all the projects with it\&#39;s own lifecycle, so an aggregator (I mean a classic one) is out of discussion here.\n\nWe are using SVN as VCS, Maven as build tool (probably you already figured out about that :) ), and Bamboo as a CI server (actually, instead of &quot;Maven Dependency Processor&quot; feature, Bamboo is not helping me to much regarding the versioning problem).\n\nDo you guys have any idea in order to find a proper solution for this problem, maybe another plugin which would help (versions-maven-plugin does not change versions automatically when branch), maybe another point of view for this, I don\&#39;t know..., any help or sugestion are welcome.\n\nThanks! (new)&#39;, &#39;I try to avoid keeping internal projects versions in the &amp;lt;properties&amp;gt; section of the parent-pom, since every time when I release a project, the &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;${project.version}&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt; variable will be switched with the explicit version of the project like: \n\n&amp;lt;properties&amp;gt;\n        &amp;lt;project_A.version&amp;gt;1.0.0-SNAPSHOT&amp;lt;/projectA.version&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/properties&amp;gt;\n\n\nstored in parent pom, translated in the projects pom like: ${project.version}, will become 1.0.1-SNAPSHOT when release that project, and will overwrite the &amp;lt;project_A.version&amp;gt; version from parent-pom &amp;lt;properties&amp;gt;. So this trick of keeping the projects versions as properties in a centralized location like the parent-pom, is valid as long as you don\&#39;t release the projects.\nThis is the question strictly related to the branching question.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, if you want I can tell you more about releasing the projects using this &amp;lt;properties&amp;gt; substitution:\nLets\&#39;s say you want to release your project_A, what will you do with the &amp;lt;projectA.version&amp;gt; stored in the parent pom &amp;lt;properties&amp;gt; which is a -SNAPSHOT version when you start to release the parent pom, right? I mean, in order to release a project, you\&#39;ll release all its dependencies and its related parent-pom first right? otherwise your project release will fail since is pointing to a -SNAPSHOT version of the parent pom.\nNow, you are releasing the parent-pom keeping the -SNAPSHOT version of project_A inside of it\&#39;s &amp;lt;properties&amp;gt;, next when you\&#39;ll release the project_A, your project will refer to the new created release version of your parent pom, which parent pom released version is refering to the -SNAPSHOT version of your project_A, still not a problem since your parent pom is keeping the true version of your project_A, until your projectA released version (lets say 1.0.0) will refer to the same parent pom released version which is containing 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT version of your project_A, and now you have a problem already because your parent pom &amp;lt;properties&amp;gt; is keeping a wrong info.\nOfcourse you can hack the parent pom when release it and store the release version of project_A, but this against the rules and I would not agree with that at all, plus that are other scenarios when this &quot;hack&quot; will cause more problems than help.\n\nI\&#39;m sorry if this sounds pretty complicated and detailed but I just want to explain as much as possible the real life situation not just theoretical, plus that I also need to keep in mind that I have 200+ projects I need to keep somehow aligned.

(new)&#39;, &quot;Our team is struggling with frequent merge conflicts due to managing multiple versions simultaneously. We&#39;re looking for a workflow that reduces these conflicts.\nOur Environments:\nWe maintain multiple environments, each running different versions of our application:\n\nPROD – Production environment\nSANDBOX – Customer testing/integration environment\nTEST – Internal testing (manual + automated) before promoting to SANDBOX\nDEV – Developer playground for feature testing and bug fixes\n\nCurrent Workflow (GitFlow):\nWe currently use GitFlow, maintaining multiple long-lived branches:\n\nrelease/1.0 – Deployed on PROD/SANDBOX; only bug fixes and critical features are merged\ndevelop – Next release candidate (deployed on TEST/DEV)\nplan/1.1, plan/1.2, etc. – Future feature branches (used when releases are delayed, but rarely)\n\nThis leads to significant merge conflicts because:\n\nChanges in release branches need to be merged into develop and plan.\nDevelop must be merged into plan after every feature or bugfix merge.\nFrequent refactoring exacerbates conflicts.\nVersion updates (pom.xml changes) cause conflicts, as both source and target branches modify the version.\n\nTrunk-Based Development (TBD) and Version Management:\nI started experimenting with TBD, hoping it would simplify our workflow. If I understand correctly, in TBD:\n\nAll development happens on trunk.\nRelease branches are created only when needed and receive cherry-picked bug fixes.\n\nThe problem I don’t understand is how to handle version updates on trunk while supporting multiple versions.\nExample Scenario:\n\nWe support 1.0.x while developing 1.1.x.\nWe create release/1.0 and start cherry-picking fixes.\nA release commit (e.g., &amp;quot;release 1.0.0&amp;quot;) happens on trunk and is cherry-picked into release/1.0.\nLater, we release 1.1.0, which updates the version in pom.xml.\nNow, if we need to release 1.0.3 with a bugfix, it looks like the version is decreasing on trunk, which is misleading.\n\nMy Questions:\n\nIn TBD, where should version updates (pom.xml changes) happen?\n\nIf they happen on the release branch, the trunk never shows version changes.\nIf they happen on trunk, it can appear as if the version is rolling back when cherry-picking bug fixes.\n\n\nWhat’s the recommended way to handle multiple active versions in TBD without causing confusion or conflicts?\n\nWould appreciate insights from teams who have successfully implemented TBD with multiple active versions.\n\nI&#39;ve read the documentation on trunkbaseddevelopment.com but it doesn&#39;t seem to address this specific problem, or maybe i misunderstood something about the concept.&quot;, &#39;The reference website says that release branches are optional.\n\nA release can happen on trunk\nOr on a release branch\n\nThe latter can happen because you might want to “harden” a release.\nWhich I interpret as cutting a release point, testing it, and incorporating\nurgent fixes.  Meanwhile trunk can continue its life with whatever\nother changes which will not impact the release branch.\nKeep in mind that there’s another dimension here:\n\nA preemptive release branch (what we just discussed)\n\nAn after-release release branch\n- - - ★ - ★ - ★ - ★ trunk\n       \\v1.0\n\n\n\nThe latter here is relevant if you released 1.0, a bug was found and\nyou need some version like 1.0.1 with just that bug fix.  But trunk\nhas many more commits at this point.  But that’s not a problem.  Just\ncheck out the tag and make a release branch.  Then you can incorporate\nthe change there.\nHow to incorporate changes between trunk and the release branches\nHow do you incorporate changes between the eternal trunk branch and\nthe releases?\nThe reference has its guideline for this:\n\nThe best practice for Trunk-Based Development teams is to reproduce\nthe bug on the trunk, fix it there with a test, watch that be verified\nby the CI server, then cherry-pick that to the release branch and wait\nfor a CI server focusing on the release branch to verify it there too.\n\nApparently this is the Trunk Based Development approach.  But I\ndisagree.  This is not the correct approach if you want to handle\nchanges in the best way with Git.\nTake the bug on v1.0 example.  Is the bug urgent enough to fix on top\nof v1.0 and make a bug fix version?  Then fix it there.\n- - - ★ - ★ - ★ - ★ trunk\n      v1.0 - ★ (bugfix)\n\nThen merge it into trunk:\n- - - ★ - ★ - ★ - ★ - - - ★ (merge) trunk\n      v1.0 - ★ (bugfix) /\n\nNow the upcoming v1.0.1 (or whatever it will be) will have the commit.\nJust query it:\ngit tag --contains=&amp;lt;bugfix commit&amp;gt;\n\nAs does trunk.  Just query it:\ngit branch --contains=&amp;lt;bugfix commit&amp;gt;\n\nYou cannot directly query it if you use cherry-picks.\nYou should also get less merge conflicts since there is less merge-base\ndrift when you avoid cherry-picks.  You can imagine multiple releases\nand multiple cherry-picks on top of release branches or trunk.  That\nmeans that Git has to go further back to calculate differences when\ndoing future merges.\nAnd if you have multiple releases?  Merge upwards from the oldest\nrelease to trunk.  For the release branches corresponding to these\ntags:\n\nv1.0.1 into 1.5.5\n1.5.5 into 1.7.0\n1.7.0 into trunk\n\nImagine having to use cherry-picks for all of that instead.  The work\ncompounds.\nWhen cherry-picks might be relevant\nThe merge approach works well when you apply the change to the correct\nplace from the start.  But sometimes you might apply a fix to trunk\nand then later figure out that you want it in some release branch as\nwell.  Use cherry-pick in that case since that’s the only option anyway.\nTBD website says not to do this\nThis should not be done according to the reference website:\n\nYou should not fix bugs on the release branch in the expectation of\ncherry-picking them back to the trunk. Why? Well in case you forget to\ndo that in the heat of the moment. Forgetting means a regression in\nproduction some weeks later (and someone getting fired).\n\n(Why not merge instead of cherry-pick?)\nThe emphasis on “forgetting” seems arbritrary here since their\nrecommended approach is to fix on trunk, then wait until CI passes,\nthen finally cherry-pick to the release branch.  Well.  What if you\nforget to cherry-pick that way?\nWe might risk getting fired here according to their corporate crystal\nball.  But fixing on the release branch and then merging to trunk is\nboth neater and prioritizes the most immediate need:\n\nThe upcoming release has the fix\nYou might break trunk with a fix that works well for the release\nbranch but not on trunk for some reason, which is a small\ninconvenience compared to a broken release\nYou have all the time until the next release to remember to merge\nto trunk before the harm is done\n\nGranted this is not a strong point if you release every day\nBut just merge immediately to trunk and don’t worry about\nforgetting it in the first place\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\nIn TBD, where should version updates (pom.xml changes) happen?\n\nThis does not have anything to do with any version strategy.  The Maven\nMasters demand a build to have the correct version.  So you need to\nhave that on whatever commit you choose to release on.\n\nWhat’s the recommended way to handle multiple active versions in TBD\nwithout causing confusion or conflicts?\n\nIt is poorly thought out.  See the reference website again:\n\nMerge Meister role\nThe process of merging commits from trunk to the release branch using\n‘cherry pick’ is a role for a single developer in a team. Or dev pair,\nif you are doing Extreme Programming. Even then, it is a part time\nactivity. The dev or pair probably needs to police a list of rules\nbefore doing the cherry pick. Rules like which business representative\nsigned off on the merge. Perhaps the role should also rotate each day.\nSome teams update a wiki to audit what made it to the release branch\nafter branch cut, and some use ticket system as this by its nature\ninterrupting and requiring of an audit trail of approvals.\n\nThe “merging” here means cherry-picking all changes that are going into\na release.\n\nA part time activity?\nPolice a set of rules?\nBusiness representative signoff?\nWiki to audit release branch?\n\nNo thanks.  All you need:\n\ntrunk is the default target for all development\nBut first target the release branch for something that is going into a\nfix for a release and you cannot do it on trunk (because trunk\nhas moved on and has things that should not go into the fix release)\nThen merge the changes into other release branches (if applicable) and\nfinally trunk\n\nNow, as mentioned, it is simple to query exactly what commits are in\nwhat tags and branches.  It’s simple to see the discrepancy between any\ntwo points in the history.

Thinking about it, you shouldn&#39;t really need to apply a version number to the trunk. The version number only really becomes relevant during the release process, but Maven (for a multitude of good reasons) requires a version number. \n\nAs an alternative, we could set the version on the trunk to 0.0-SNAPSHOT, which would essentially denote a special build. The problem with this though, is that it would place it before every other version, as far as Maven is concerned.\n\nAn alternative might be to use some very large number. This would at least place is after every other version, which is true if the trunk represents the tip of your development. This feels a bit arbitrary though.\n\nThe only other option I can see, is to use a string version - e.g. HEAD or LATEST, but this wouldn&#39;t conform to the latest Maven versioning scheme.

(new)&#39;, &#39;We use Subversion and aside from a few individuals such as myself there is little to no experience with branching and merging in Subversion. My Subversion experience is limited to simple feature branches where merge and tree-conflicts, while not exactly rare, are not exceedingly difficult to resolve.\n\nGiven that, I am helping to manage a project where our current commit to trunk method is simply unsustainable for our needs. I introduced feature branching and merging to my localized team and we had some success. However simple feature branching was still not able to answer all our questions such as:\n\n\nHow do we develop code in parallel for this release and subsequent releases?\nWhat code is considered stable?\nWhat (in development) code is going into the next release?\nWhat (in development) code is going into a subsequent release?\nWhat version of code is our Test, Acceptance, or Production environments?\nHow do we integrate concurrent development activities with a known stable release to reduce introducing bugs and incomplete work?\nHow do we provide hot-fixes to released code?\nHow do we know, from our source control, what development activity is currently ongoing?\nHow do we experiment or R&amp;amp;D without disrupting the current code base while leveraging?\n\n\nIt seems that  git-flow as defined here would go a long way to answer a lot of these questions. I experimented with this method in Mercurial and it seems like that it is possible to implement this method there as well. Sadly, migrating to a DVCS is off the table at this point.\n\nHowever, my brief attempt to mimic this method in Subversion failed with many merge and tree conflicts. The merge options and edge cases are numerous and baffling.\n\nCan Subversion be used to implement git-flow and if so what is the pain level? (new)&#39;, &quot;We use what is called the unstable trunk development method. This was the development methodology that the creators of Subversion had in mind when they created Subversion. It&#39;s simple and easy to implement.\n\n\nYou do all of your development on trunk. Thus called the unstable trunk.\nWhen you get close to a release, you make a branch for that release. The idea is to make the branch late enough to keep parallel development as short as possible, but not so later that some developers can&#39;t do their jobs because they no longer need to work on the current release, but need to start working on the next release. In Agile, this is usually done right before the firming sprint. It&#39;s usually done when the release is feature complete, and now you&#39;re just fixing bugs.\nThe release takes place off of the branch. You tag off the branch. If there are patches that are needed, they&#39;re done off of the branch.\n\n\nHere&#39;s an idea how it works:\n\n\nImagine you&#39;re working on Release 1.2. You are working on the trunk. Now, you&#39;re getting close to the time when Release 1.2 is about to be released, and there&#39;s not enough work on Release 1.2 to keep your developers busy. You create a 1.2 branch for your release.\nNow, the people still working on Release 1.2 switch over to the Release 1.2 branch. Meanwhile, developers working on 1.3 stay on trunk.\nYou are now ready to Release 1.2. You tag Release 1.2 right on the branch. The branch is not merged back into trunk. The trunk is for Release 1.3.\nBugs are reported, and you want to fix them in Release 1.2.1. You continue working off the 1.2 branch. No new branch needed for 1.2.1. (You can lock branches between releases to keep them pure.\nWhen you are about to do Release 1.3, you repeat the process -- branch 1.3 and work for 1.4 continues on the trunk.\n\n\nThere will be some merging. It&#39;s mainly merging defects fixed on the release branch back to trunk. There are three options of doing this:\n\n\nOnce you do a release, you merge enmass all changes on the branch back to trunk. There&#39;s very little tracking. You&#39;re just assuming that all the bug fixes on the branch also apply to the trunk.\nYou use a tracking systems that understands issues may live on more than one release. In this case, you simply mark a bug discovered on the branch to trunk too. You can cherry pick changes that apply to trunk thanks to your issue tracking system.\nSome sites simply don&#39;t merge. They also track via the defect tracking system changes that need to be applied to the trunk that were applied on the branch, and simply re-implement them. They might copy changes from the branch to trunk, but they never do a formal merge. However, once you do this, you can&#39;t ever merge (unless you merge with the --record-only flag).\n\n\nYou, of course, realize that this method takes something called planning. You must prioritize your work, so the developers do the work for the upcoming release before work on the future release. You only branch once you no longer have enough work on the upcoming release to keep all of your developers busy.\n\nYou can implement the standard Git workflow which is using development separate development branches for each developer or issue, and then delivering those changes onto trunk. This would require a lot of branches, one for each developer/feature.\n\nYou first merge from the trunk to the branch to rebase your code. Once you&#39;ve done the rebase, you merge from the branch back to the trunk using the --reintegrate switch. Pre-1.6, you were suppose to delete the branch and recreate it since --reintegrate sort of messed up merge tracking. However, this has been fixed in Release 1.6.x and up. (new)&quot;, &quot;That&#39;s a big question. I only have ideas how to solve some of the problems:\n\n\nI don&#39;t think this can easily be solved without using branches a lot. Not sure if this can be easily solved by using GIT either. Feature branches go a long way in solving this problem, but in general you should probably try to concentrate on features for the next release only.\ntrunk - I consider it the master branch.\nI&#39;d say the development branch is the code for the next release\nSeems difficult without using a lot of branches, no idea how to properly solve this.\nYou could use branches or note the revision number being in TEST and ACC. PROD should be put into a tag I guess.\nI&#39;d say using automated regression tests and continuous integration. Also using peer reviews can help here, at best you use some sort of tool to mark a file as reviewed. That way you can ensure that you only merge files that have been reviewed. It could also be interesting to tie your commit messages to your bugtracker, to automatically figure out which files have been touched in relation to which issues, and then make sure all issues are actually closed for the files you want to merge. This is a non trivial task, especially if you are thinking about merging only parts of branches. Thereby, sort of, doing a feature merge.\nUse a tag for the release. You can check it out just like a branch and add patches if necessary\nList all svn commits for the entire repository on one page (e.g. trac/redmine/jira overview)\nUse a local copy I&#39;m afraid/or a branch again. Or make the R&amp;amp;D use git svn locally for research.\n\n\nSome of these problems can, at least partly, be solved by using git svn. By using it you can for example to experiments locally using gits branch features, without storing those in the global repository. Of course this is not interesting if you are exploring a new feature with many members on a team, unless they are all comfortable with using git and pulling from each other over the network. \nBy using git svn you can also use git cherrypick to hand pick single commits to apply from one branch to another (e.g. development onto released-x.x-tag).\n\nThat&#39;s all I could come up with for now, hope it helps. (new)&quot;, &#39;In my activities I use SVN with the following approach.\n\n\nTrunk is the &quot;master&quot; branch. You should never commit anything directly in the trunk. Trunk always need to match exactly the latest released version in production.\nSo, trunk always represent a stable branch.\nTrunk is updated only with reintegration of branches.\nYou need branches for your work. Every new branch has to be created from the trunk, so every new branch match exactly with the production version at creation time.\nChanges and fixes are committed in the branches.\nYou should have at least 2 main branches:\n\n\ndevelop: intended for future developments that are not already planned for release.\nhotfix: used to commit all bugfix and only fixes. For frequent use, It need to be updated with trunk version when the trunk is updated.\n\nCreate a branch for every main stream of work: a project, a subproject, a change request. You can work with parallel developments.\nCreate &quot;integration&quot; branches to join branches that you have to release. You need to merge into the integration branch every branch candidated to the release.\nSo, integration branch can join both hotfix and a project, for example.\nBuild your artifacts from integration branches or from the branches self.\nWhen you have released a branch, create the tag for that release, so you can have a copy of the released version and you can still work the branch.\nIn tags you should have only released version. Don\&#39;t commit changes in the tag!\nAfter a branch is released, you need to update the trunk. So reintegrate the branch in the trunk. You can reintegrate an integration branch, or the branch directly (if you didn\&#39;t pass from the integration).\nWhen the trunk is again matched with production version, report it in all your active branches.\n\n\nThis method is not really a replica of the git-flow concept, but It follows some of its requirements.\n\nWith this approach you can have the following advantages:\n\n\ntrunk is stable. You always know what trunk represents at that moment.\nEvery branch contains only its own changes.\nWith integration branches you can manage parallel branches in a single release\nWith tags you always have a copy of a released version\n\n\nThe disadvantages are:\n\n\nMany branches to manage.\nYou need to merge and switch very often, expecially to report changes into integration branches\nMany conflicts to solve every time\n\n\nBy the way, this is the best approach I ever worked with because It allows you to keep the control of versions.

How to update a tag to include a newer revision of just 1 file?\n\nAfter creating a View Label in StarTeam (similiar to a tag in SVN) - I was able to include a newer revision of a file into that view label - e.g. update the view to include only that file (and not others that also changed since the creation of that View Label\n\n2. How to create a tag based on another tag? \n\nWhen development continues while releasing a version, some features are not to be included although they are checked in. In StarTeam, I used to create a view label (again, like a tag) based on a previous view (and then do what I describe in question 1). I understand that in SVN I can create a tag based on another, but that it is read only, and I need a branch. but I don&#39;t really need a branch, really.\n\n3. How to check-in / add to an existing tag? \n\nIn StarTeam the view label is on the trunk / branch, so I could check in a file after a view is created and modify the lable to include it, in SVN I have to check into the branch (new)&quot;, &#39;Let me preface by saying I\&#39;m not familiar with StarTeam, so I may not fully understand the workflow you\&#39;re trying to reproduce.\n\nSubversion itself doesn\&#39;t differentiate between tags and branches. By convention, a tag is just a branch that you never modify. Even a branch is just an &quot;svn copy&quot; operation, there isn\&#39;t a separate &quot;branch&quot; feature. A branch is just a cheap copy, and a tag is a branch that is read-only by convention only. Copies in svn are very cheap, so you don\&#39;t need to worry about creating branches a lot - a tag is not any cheaper than a branch. You may want to read the docs on Creating a Branch. It further explains things... and has a boxed section about &quot;Cheap Copies&quot;.\n\nDepending on your use of &quot;View Labels&quot; in StarTeam, it is possible that svn externals may be useful for your purposes. I don\&#39;t generally like them, but it depends on the scenario.\n\nOn to your questions more directly...\n\n1) This will depend on if there are other changes in the file. Do you want the changes from one revision in one file? Or all changes for 1 file (multiple revisions, only the 1 file). Hopefully you mean the former. In which case, the usual behavior would be to merge \n\nLet\&#39;s say you have the following scenario:\n\n------------------------------------&amp;gt; /trunk\n |     | fix merged to 1.0 branch\n |     v\n  \\------------&amp;gt; /branches/1.0\n    |  ^ |\n    |    \\ /tags/1.1  1.1 tag, fix released to customer(s)\n    \\ /tags/1.0 - 1.0 GA tag, release sent to customer(s)\n\n\nYou develop on trunk. At revision 10, your product is already ready to ship 1.0! You create a branch with:\n\nsvn copy /path/to/trunk /path/to/branches/1.0\n\n\nYou then continue developing on trunk, while also doing a bit of extra verification on the 1.0 branch. When it is ready to ship, you create a tag:\n\nsvn copy /path/to/branches/1.0 /path/to/tags/1.0\n\n\nThis tag is a frozen point in time that exactly matches what you are shipping to customers.\n\nYou discover a bug/feature/update that is needed for your 1.0 release customers that has already been done on trunk. In your case, you\&#39;ve stated changes to a particular file.\n\nLet\&#39;s say the changes occurred on trunk in revision 15. You\&#39;d then do (from a clean /branches/1.0 working copy):\n\nsvn merge -c 15 /url/to/repo/path/to/trunk\n\n\nIn the ideal case, the changes of a revision are self-contained and all files in the revision are needed. Sometimes there is also extra things you do not want to merge. In this case, after the merge, revert the changes to files you do not want merged, test everything, and then commit. There is a downside to the merge -&gt; revert some files -&gt; commit workflow, which is that subversion will record the merge as happening, yet you\&#39;ve excluded portions of it. If the branch in question isn\&#39;t likely to change much further (or reintegrate to another branch) it may not matter, but I prefer creating a patch file for the changes in the 1 file you want and applying them to the branch manually for cases like that. I\&#39;m not 100% certain on the cmd line syntax, but I think it would be quite similar:\n\nsvn diff -c 15 /path/to/file (in repo or other working copy) &gt; my-patch.diff\n\nand apply with another tool. I usually create/apply patches in a GUI, so the specifics will be left as an exercise to you.\n\nOnce done with that, you create a new tag off your branch again, that will contain your new merged change.\n\nsvn copy /path/to/branches/1.0 /path/to/tags/1.1\n\nYou then have a new tag that is the same as the old tag, except for having the changes to the 1 file. In #3 I will also mention that you can recreate the tag (though it depends what you are using the tag for on whether it is a good idea).\nr, but I would only do this if the tag does not represent shipped code.\n\n2) Indeed, since by convention a tag is read only, a tag from another tag would not really be different. However, if you instead use a branch for the first one, then create a tag off that (as suggested), you can later create a second tag based off of the same branch (after committing additional changes) and it will differ from your first tag by only the changes that have been applied to that branch since then. \n\n3) Again, you would normally use a branch. If the branch/tag is used solely internally (I do not recommend ever deleting a release tag of shipped code, although it isn\&#39;t really &quot;lost&quot;, it just shouldn\&#39;t normally be necessary - ), you can just delete &amp;amp; recreate the tag. Consumers of your tag (working copies) can just do a normal &quot;svn update&quot; after the tag is deleted &amp;amp; recreated and will continue to work fine as if nothing happened. This couldn\&#39;t be used for #1 but could be for #2 when really you just want to update a tag. The trick is combine tagging and branching to achieve what you want. If you\&#39;re also using this to deploy toa website or something, you can combine branching, tagging, and externals.\n\ne.g. /path/to/production can be checked out which has an externals entry to /tags/1.0, and when you want to apply a fix you perform the steps in #2 and create a /tags/1.1 and adjust the externals entry. Or, just have it point at the branch and no need to recreate tags. \n\nI hope that is a semi-useful start.

What are some strategies that people use to define features appropriately so that they are easy to manage across multiple applications/platforms?\n\n2) Have you replaced most/all of your git / Bitbucket / ?? branching workflow with feature flags and purely trunk - based development? If not, have you made significant changes to your existing git / Bitbucket branching strategy? (new)&quot;, &quot;Disclamer: I work at DevCycle\nI&#39;m a few years late, but, I really wanted to make sure anyone finding their way to this question has a little more information.\n1) While levlaz provided an answer explaining that you should put your management as far up the stack as possible, I don&#39;t necessarily agree that this is the best approach to consider first.\nConsider this: A simple setup of a single feature across multiple platforms\nWithin DevCycle (and others), when you create a Feature, it is available across all platforms and the API.\nYou simply request the features for a user on any platform, and if the user qualifies, you&#39;ll receive it. There is no extra setup necessary to enable it on various platforms.\nThis means that if a feature is meant to be accessed on either your Java backend or React frontend, you can be guaranteed that the feature will be available at the correct times for the correct user/service regardless of where you call it from.\nIn short: one single Feature is managed across all platforms in one spot, with one toggle (if desired).\nAnother Approach: A single feature across multiple platform with different toggles or use cases.\nYou could very easily simply create multiple flags for each individual platform a feature is meant to be available on, and manage each individually. However, this isn&#39;t entirely necessary!\nWithin a feature setup, you can simply have two separate rules defining different variations being delivered to each platform. For example, you can set up a simple rule which ensures that Java will receive the feature, but React would not.\n\nA unique DevCycle approach: Managing multiple platforms independently.\nHere is something DevCycle offers that would may handle your use case in a unique way:\nImagine every single time you create a feature, both a Java and React version of that feature are created.\nThese platforms would be managed separately within each feature, meaning that there is no potential of any accidental feature data bleeding between platforms in event that a feature doesn&#39;t exist on one platform but it does on another.\n\nYou can set up each platform as an entirely separate entity, meaning they would use different SDK keys, and all targeting will always be separate.\nIn the example above for example, the feature would be entirely disabled and not available in any Java SDKs calling out to DevCycle, but it would be available in React.\ntl;dr\nIt&#39;s up to you how you want to manage things across platforms. DevCycle makes it easy to do this however you&#39;d like: have all features across all platforms, splitting up your platforms, or just choosing to target differently depending on the feature.\n2) Like levlaz said, that is the ideal, but you&#39;ll likely never want to achieve fully trunk-based nirvana, as there are a lot of use cases for having various environments and paths for your team to take in various scenarios.\nThat said, we&#39;ve seen a lot of folks successfully get REALLY close by using Feature Flags.\nI wouldn&#39;t suggest removing your build pipelines and CI/CD in favor of feature flags, instead, feature flags enhance those.\nFor example, with feature flags, you can remove the concept of feature branches and large feature pull requests. Instead, ensure that everything that ever gets put into production is always behind a feature flag. To ensure this happens, you can use workflow tools like github actionsthat do these safety checks for you. With these guards in place, you should now always be able to simply push through to prod without any concerns and run your deploy scripts on each merge. Then you can just target your internal / QA users for testing, and not worry about things hitting prod users!\nYou may still want to have some sort of disaster recovery environment and local environments, so never truly hitting a pure trunk, but you can get close!&quot;, &#39;[Disclamer: I work at LaunchDarkly]\n\nFor your first question, my general recommendation is to put flags as &quot;high up on the stack&quot; as possible. At the end of the day, you are making a decision somewhere. Where you put that decision point is entirely up to you. Within LaunchDarkly the flags are agnostic to the implementation so a single flag can live on the server, mobile, and client-side without any issues. Keep things simple. \n\nFor your second question, in practice, it is very rare to see teams fully make the switch to trunk-based development. This is the goal of 99% of the teams that I work with but depending on if you have a greenfield or a brownfield project the complexity of making the switch can be not worth the effort. \n\nLastly, Our CTO wrote a book this year called &quot;Effective Feature Management&quot;[1]. If you have not heard of this, I would recommend you take a look. I think you\&#39;ll find some great insights there. \n\nhttps://launchdarkly.com/effective-feature-management-ebook/&#39;]</td><td class="s6" dir="ltr">[&#39;Use feature flags to safely integrate incomplete features&#39;, &#39;Use feature flags to Support progressive delivery (A/B testing, dark launches)&#39;, &#39;Use feature flags to decouple deployment from release&#39;, &#39;Simplifies the development workflow (+)&#39;, &#39;Promote frequent and rapid integration (CI) (+)&#39;, &#39;Reduce merge conflicts (+)&#39;, &#39;Shortens automated feedback cycles by testing each trunk commit against the main codebase through CI/CD pipelines (+).&#39;, &#39;Cultural or organizational resistance is common (-)&#39;, &#39;Requires robust testing and test infrastructure (-)&#39;, &#39;Requires strong discipline and team coordination (-)&#39;]</td></tr><tr style="height: 30px"><th id="1569038740R158" style="height: 30px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 30px">159</div></th><td class="s7" dir="ltr">feature toggling in AEM</td><td class="s8" dir="ltr">49005063</td><td class="s9" dir="ltr"><a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49005063/feature-toggling-in-aem">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49005063/feature-toggling-in-aem</a></td><td class="s10" dir="ltr">YANLIŞ</td><td class="s7" dir="ltr">[&#39;feature toggling in AEM (new)&#39;, &#39;I want to implement a CI/CD process in our AEM Project.

We want to enable dark launching (https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/hammering-usernames/96390263919/ ) where we separate deployment and release and the crucial bit for this is feature toggling / flag.\n\nOur AEM implementation normal feature stories include simple dialog field changes / css changes to all type of implmentations.\n\nI am planning to use AEM OOTB as the feature toggle mechanism ( http://sling.apache.org/documentation/the-sling-engine/featureflags.html ) as this gives a OOTB console as well (http://localhost:4502/system/console/features ). A  good example is explained at ( aemtreasury.wordpress.com/2015/10/20/feature-flags/ ). But the major issue is with the xml based file changes ( dialog.xml, _cq_editConfig.xml, .content.xml etc ) which makes the major part of AEM development. I need a way to inject the feature flag value to all the XMLs in AEM.\n\nMy idea is to inject the value to these xmls and write conditions to use the feature flag to toggle anything associated to the feature. Is there any best practices I should follow to achieve this capability or any documentation to guide me in the right direction. \n\nThanks in advance.&#39;, &quot;I&#39;m not sure why do you need feature flags. I worked in multiple projects with CI/CD and git flow. If you cannot test feature branch on separate environment, I would suggest to have master and develop branch, where develop branch will contain all features which are currently in development / QA.\n\nHaving develop branch also protects you from issues which might occur after integration of feature with stable version. For example if feature A affects feature B, you will know that if you will merge feature A to master branch, the feature B will require some code changes.

Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services offer great managed database services and then you can run rest of your application serverless, in containers or however you like it. It won&#39;t be free though, but if it&#39;s low traffic service the costs are probably less than a hundred bucks a month. Especially if you&#39;re using Terraform or similar tool to bring your development environment up and destroy it, when it&#39;s not needed, it&#39;s going to be almost free. (new)&quot;, &quot;Heroku is a good platform to start with: each app can be deployed directly from GitHub or (more fun) creating/pushing/deploying via the Docker registry. They will be exposed via HTTS and can be configured with Env Variables (ie secrets. There is a free-tier for this and you can create as many apps as you like (they will sleep after some inactivity).\n\nRedis is also supported and free, but it is not persisted: it is a good way to use/exercise it but you need to (re)populate with the data (after every restart).\n\nDBs are not free (this is the case for all providers I think) but not expensive.\n\nHeroku doesnt have a persistent storage, not even a file system (only for tmp files).\n\nThe Dashboard is great: you can check deployment and application logs, see the status, etc.. and there is also the CLI (command line) to perform anything you need without using the Dashboard.\n\nI think the developer experience on Heroku is great, definitely a good way to get going without having to worry about cost and usage. After that it is possible to &#39;upgrade&#39; to production-like services (paying for what you need).\nWhat is really important is what you learn can definitely be applied to other cloud services, in case one day you want/need to change.\n\nGood luck!

We are trying to figure out how to manage our workflow.  In particular, we are trying to see if creating remote heads is the right solution.\n\nWe currently have a very large repository with multiple, related projects.  They share a lot of code, but pieces of the project are deployed by different teams (3 teams) independent of other portions of the code-base.  So each team is working on concurrent large features.\n\nThe way we currently handles this in SVN are branches.  Team1 has a branch for Feature1, same deal for the other teams.  When Team1 finishes their change, it gets merged into the trunk and deployed out.  The other teams follow suite when their project is complete, merging of course.\n\nSo my initial thought are using Named Branches for these situations.  Team1 makes a Feature1 branch off of the default branch in Hg.  Now, here is the question. Should the team PUSH that branch, in it\&#39;s current/half-state to the repository.  This will create a second head in the core repo.\n\nMy initial reaction was &quot;NO!&quot; as it seems like a bad idea.  Handling multiple heads on our repository just sounds awful, but there are some advantages...\n\nFirst, the teams want to setup Continuous Integration to build this branch during their development cycle (months long).  This will only work if the CI can pull this branch from the repo.  This is something we do now with SVN, copy a CI build and change the branch.  Easy.\n\nSecond, it makes it easier for any team member to jump onto the branch and start working.  Without pushing to the core repo, they would have to receive a push from a developer on that team with the changeset information.  It is also possible to lose local commits to hardware failure.  The chances increase a lot if it\&#39;s a branch by a single developer who has followed the &quot;don\&#39;t push until finished&quot; approach.\n\nAnd lastly is just for ease of use.  The developers can easily just commit and push on their branch at any time without consequence (as they do today, in their SVN branches).\n\nIs there a better way to handle this scenario that I may be missing? I just want a veteran\&#39;s opinion before moving forward with the strategy.\n\nFor bug fixes we like the general workflow of Mercurial, anonymous branches that only consist of 1-2 commits.  The simplicity is great for those cases.\n\nBy the way, I\&#39;ve read this, great article which seems to favor Named branches. (new)&#39;, &quot;You&#39;re definitely thinking about this right, and it sounds like you&#39;re going down a good path.  I&#39;m a branches as clones person, but named branches have come a long way.\n\nHaving a central-ish repo to which all named branches are pushed is convenient for control and backups.  Teams working on only branch X can easily create their own branch X only repo by doing hg clone -r X central-ish repo.\n\nThe best thing you can do to help the teams out is to let them do clones themselves somewhere that&#39;s sitting behind a hgwebdir.cgi  instance (as, presumably your central-ish repo will be).  You&#39;ll find not just teams, but sub-teams and pairs of teams will set up their own repos for mini-efforts you never new about.  They&#39;ll put them on the named branches that make sense to them and merge back into central as appropriate. (new)&quot;, &#39;I would make the decision if these three projects should go into one repository by the coupling between these projects (and how many patches are interchanged within them). The more independent they are the less are the advantages of having them in one repo (backup and management aside). There are some different kind of setups:\n\n\nAs you showed, one repository, with one branch for the shared code, and one branch for each project. When the projects itself are generated by forking the shared code base care must be taken when merging back to common (cherry-picking). When inside of each project-branch updates to the common-branch are generated as direct ancestors of the common-branch, and get merges into the project-branch, chances are good they can also be merged back into common. But if changes to common are developed on top of the project branch, merging back will require cherry-picking. I don\&#39;t have experiences with such a setup, but I fear that the merges can get problematic.\none repo for the shared code and one for each project, connected by symlinks or as subrepo. Here care must be taken to not step on each others feed. In my experience this kind of usage has the potential to grow into a very big PITA. OTOH you seem to have this setup already and your fellow developers can work with it.\none repo for shared and one for each project, with the code from the shared one used as internal releases. I would go for this setup when there are not big regular changes on the shared code base.\n\n\nAll these situations can also be combined with customization-branches for each project within the common part. But I would try to minimize the number of currently active branches, since every new branch requires additional care of merges.\n\nI\&#39;m sorry to not give a concrete answer, but &quot;The right thing&quot; (TM) depends to much on the local details.

Best practice?  I don\&#39;t know.  \n\nAfter the process is completed, one &quot;side effect&quot; I don\&#39;t understand is that bitbucket reports the staging branch is being behing and ahead of master?

This is the result after the first double merge.\n\n          - - - - - 5 [staging]\n         /         /\n        | Z - Y - X\n        |/         \\\n1 - 2 - 3 - - - - - 4 [master]\n\n\nNote that while staging and master have the same content, they have different commit ids and histories. This will make things complicated. Not only will you have to resolve any merge conflicts twice (and possibly differently) but it kills a major feature of Git: the same commits have the same IDs.\n\nWait, it gets worse. Because you merge to staging immediately, then QA, then merge to master after QA, it\&#39;s possible for features to be merged to master and staging in different orders. Not only does this produce a gross history, it can produce different merge conflicts with different resolutions. Now you really don\&#39;t know if master and staging are the same. You can check with git diff master staging but it\&#39;ll be hard to track down where the differences leaked in and why.\n\n            - - - - - 5 - - - - 6 - 7 [staging]\n           /         /         /  /\n          /         / E - F - G -+-\n         /         / /          /  \\\n        | Z - Y - X /  J - K - L    \\\n        |/         \\|/          \\    \\\n1 - 2 - 3 - - - - - 4 - - - - - - 8 - 9 [master]\n\n\nIn this example, EFG and JKL both start from the same commit on master. EFG is merged into staging before JKL, but JKL completes QA first and is merged back into master before EFG. master and staging are now possibly different. Also your history graph is gross and hard to understand.\n\nI guess you\&#39;re using this Skullcandy workflow? I\&#39;ve never seen a workflow like that in practice where you habitually merge to two branches. It seems overly complicated. You\&#39;re new to Git, keep it simple. Just branch from master and merge back into master. This produces a graph with the desirable &quot;feature bubbles&quot;.\n\n          Z - Y - X   J - K - L\n         /         \\ /         \\\n1 - 2 - 3 - - - - - 4 - - - - - 8 - 9 [master]\n                     \\             /\n                      E - F - G - -\n\n\nNow there is only one order in which features are merged.\n\nStaging is not necessary in this workflow. Individual changes can be QA\&#39;d directly from the feature branch before merging back into master.\n\nIt would look like this...\n\n\ngit fetch origin; git checkout -b feature/1234 origin/master\nWork on the feature.\n\n\nMake changes.\nRun dev tests, fix until they pass.\nCommit.\nRepeat.\n\nUpdate the feature branch as necessary.\n\n\ngit fetch origin\nIf not shared, git rebase origin/master.\nIf shared, git merge origin/master.\n\ngit push -u origin feature/1234.\n\n\nCI server runs automated tests against feature/1234.\nIf they fail, back to step 3.\n\nCreate pull request for feature/1234 to master.\nQA tests feature/1234.\n\n\nUpdate the feature branch if necessary (see step 3).\nIf it fails, back to step 2.\n\nAfter feature passes QA, then it is merged into master.\n\n\nMerge to master. git merge --no-ff master (or use Bitbucket\&#39;s built in merging)\nDelete the remote branch. git push origin :feature/1234.\nDelete the local branch. git branch -d feature/1234.\n\n\n\nThe key difference is that the change is QA\&#39;d directly from the feature branch before merging. There\&#39;s no need to maintain a separate staging branch and duplicate merging. No untested branches get merged into anything.\n\nIt\&#39;s important to note that updating the feature branch by merging (or rebasing) master into it has the same content as if you merged the feature branch into master. This is why you can QA directly from the feature branch.\n\nA staging branch should instead be used to track what you\&#39;re testing for the next release candidate. It\&#39;s used as a stable spot for QA to shield the release candidate from changes to master. It is nothing more than a spot on the normal history. In our example above, staging might point to commit 2.\n\nAlso note that rather than doing one big git commit -a when you\&#39;re done with your feature, you can do small commits as you go.  Fix a typo?  Test &amp;amp; commit.  Add a new method?  Test &amp;amp; commit.  Perform a refactoring?  Test &amp;amp; commit.  This breaks up your work into easy to understand chunks, it\&#39;s much easier to map each line with an explanation of why it\&#39;s there.  When combined with testing, it makes debugging much easier. It was passing at the last commit, so it must be something changed since then. If your git diff is small it will be easier to spot the change which caused the bug. If you decide a change was a bad idea, it\&#39;s easier to throw just that change out.\n\n\n\nMy central philosophy is that under normal operation feature work should be isolated, merging should be simple and the dev branch should be ready for QA at all times. Developers shouldn\&#39;t have to merge into multiple branches (like in Skullcandy). Cherry picking changes between branches should be an exceptional operation. The dev branch should be CI tested. Feature branches should be complete before merging to development. Staging and production should be simply older commits on the development branch.\n\nGit is far more flexible than SVN, exceptional cases can be handled as they happen. If hot fixes and cherry picking are necessary, they should be rolled back into development as quickly as possible. You can even use rebase to rewrite history and smooth everything out to make the normal flow work better. I know this idea of rewriting history probably freaks you out right now, you\&#39;ll get used to it.\n\nThis makes development in branches faster and simpler and it increases the number of people who can review and merge changes.

We use Jira for issue tracking, and Plastic branches to link change sets with open issues.  With the switch, I’ve also adopted the branch-per-task approach to development.  This has lead to an interesting dilemma when it comes to fixing bugs that have been re-opened (a new test case has discovered the bug was not fully fixed after an iteration/release to test)\n\nI’ve fixed a bug, ran my tests (available at the time) against it and it passed.  I merged the code, and developed a second feature that touched the same file.  Both changes have been done on different branches, and both were successfully merged into the main build branch.  The new build goes to QA and they discover a slightly different way to re-produce the same issue (a new test case) and re-open the bug. The original bug branch does not include the new features added to the same file because they are on different branches (e.g. bug 1 fixes are part of feature 2 branch [as this branch was created after the original fix was merged to the build branch], but the new feature 2 code is not on the bug 1 branch)\n\nGiven this scenario: What is the best practice for bug fixing when the bug has been re-opened and you are using the branch-per-task approach?\n\n\nWould it be better to clone the bug in Jira to create a new issue\nnumber, create a new branch and re-fix the issue as if it is new?\n[this would essentially base the new fix on the combination of the\noriginal fix + the new feature] (Would this make it harder to merge\nacross versions if you had to track multiple fixes for the same\nissue?)\nWould it be better to go back to the original branch where the\noriginal issue was fixed, and re-fix it, then merge again, dealing\nwith conflict resolution every time this sort of thing happens?\n\n\nNote:\n\n\nBranches are created to link with a bug tracking system (Jira), so\nthe branch names include the issue number.\nBecause of this link, I can’t create 2 branches with the same name\nunless they have different parents. So, I could create a second branch from the original, but not from the build branch (which is the parent of the original issue)\n\n\nIt seems that the branch per task method would cause conflict resolution to occur repeatedly between the bug fix and the feature until both were completely tested and resolved, since there is no merging across these task branches – only to the trunk, they will both be continuously “out of date” with each other.\n\nI’m betting this will not be a common occurrence for a single developer, but it may occur more often with larger teams, even if it is not specifically between a bug and a feature (conceivable, two features could affect the same file(s), causing additional conflict resolution during the life of the build/test cycle before release)\n\nThis process works almost the opposite of how the team used CVS in the past, so I’m trying to find the “right” way to do it to minimize the pain of moving forward with the new model.\nBefore, I would just go get the latest changes from the last build and make the new fix – thus, avoiding any conflict resolution issues (but I don\&#39;t get the benefits of branch per task).  \n\nNow, I have to think of what branch the &quot;original&quot; fix was done on, and if that is the correct place where the &quot;new&quot; fix needs to go to keep the issue tracking system in sync with the change set list. (new)&#39;, &#39;there\&#39;re multiple alternatives and solutions for the situation you\&#39;re asking, I\&#39;m going to explain my favorite one for each situation I can think off:\n\n(1) The 2 branches are integrated in the &quot;Release branch&quot; AKA &quot;/main&quot; and you don\&#39;t want to subtractive them.\n\nIn this situation you have to create a new task in Jira, link it to the task that has caused the issue and set it as a regression if it\&#39;s the case.\n\nNow that you have a new task in Jira you can create a new branch in Plastic. This new branch will base from the last cset/label in the &quot;/main&quot; branch.\n\nDevelop the fix and integrate it in the next release when it has all the QA on green.\n\n(2) The tasks can\&#39;t remain in the &quot;Release branch&quot; and they must be subtracted\n\nYou will perform a subtractive merge of the changesets created in the &quot;/main&quot; branch, so the &quot;Release branch&quot; will be reverted to an stable point.\n\nThe Jira task is reopened, even re-estimated.\n\nThe developer will continue the work in the task branch to adequate the code with the new requirements.\n\nOnce the task is complete the regular branch-per-task cycle goes on.\n\nHope it helps!

Then, they can work on the branches at the same time. Doing check in, check out, etc. After completing their tasks, they can merge their braches back to the trunk.

Develop and Release are branches off master. We wan&#39;t to create a feature branch from develop and after we are done merge it back to develop via a pull request. QA does all the testing on the develop branch. After the QA gives approval we wan&#39;t to merge the feature branch off develop into the release branch. Now the issue here is that if there were 10 previous features merged into develop BEFORE we created this feature branch then all those 10 features&#39; commits will also be included in the merge request.\n\nWhat we wan&#39;t to know is how to merge ONLY the commits in the FEATURE BRANCH into the release branch.\n\nWe looked at git flow which creates the release branch off develop at the end of the sprint but the problem is that it will include all features merged to develop. In our system we do QA testing on the develop branch and not the individual feature branches, in git flow your supposed to test first each feature branch individually to avoid premature integration and reduce reverts. We might be able to use that but the thing is that we cannot have the resources of setting up servers for all of our features to be tested (server/deployment per feature)\n\nA basic idea of what is happening now with our svn existing workflow\n\nWe have two branches, trunk and staging. We start our work on trunk, after we have finished our feature we commit our work to trunk. Afterwords we get a release done for the trunk branch to the QA environment. The QA tests that feature, after we get an OK from the QA we merge our feature to the staging branch. To do this we select the required revisions from trunk and merge them to the staging branch. The QA then does another final regression test. At the end of our sprint we do a build from staging to production and demo environments.\n\nDoes anyone know how we could use two branches develop and release and create feature branches from develop and only merge the feature branches changes to the release branch. This is as we can only have two test environments per each branch. Note that this app does not have any unit tests either.\n\nTo Alexander Polomodov\n\nEDIT UPDATE 1\n\nThanks for your insight. I added this to the main post since the comment size was not enough. Ironically this is what we are trying out initially but didn&#39;t find it to meet our needs. The primary reason being that whenever we create a feature branch off release, if there is a conflict it will be only detected when tried to be merged to the develop branch. This is as we are starting our local development without the changes of other people. Now let&#39;s say I fixed the merge conflict, for now let&#39;s say in the feature branch itself (there is a problem of where I fix it, more on this a bit later). Then after QA is passed and gives me the OK, I merge my branch into release. Now however I get another conflict, why? Due to the fact that I simply resolved a merged conflict to match the develop branch and now the other person&#39;s code that caused this conflict is not going live. If we were to create a feature branch off develop and when we submit a merge request from develop to release IF the commits in the branch only were taken somehow, then the only problem remaining would be fixing the any merge conflicts ONCE on the release branch. And since we create the feature branch off develop everyone would be working with other peoples code.\n\nEDIT UPDATE 2\n\nI tried the second method but couldn&#39;t make it work, in theory that is what I wanted to do. I created some sample steps I used.\n\n#create the repository    \ngit init \n\n#create the initial java source\nmkdir src \ngedit src/Test.java \n\n#add and commit the code to the repository in master\ngit add src\ngit commit \n\n#create the release branch from master\ngit checkout -b release \n\n#create the develop branch from master\ngit checkout master\ngit checkout -b develop \n\n#create the feature1 branch from develop\ngit checkout -b feature1 \ngedit src/Test.java #add another method\ngit add src/\ngit commit\n\n#merge the feature1 to develop\ngit checkout develop\ngit merge feature1\n\n#create the feature2 branch from develop after the merge\ngit checkout -b feature2 \ngedit src/Test.java #add another method\ngit add src/\ngit commit\n\n#merge the feature2 to develop\ngit checkout develop\ngit merge feature2\n\n#create a branch for rebasing the feature2\ngit checkout feature2\ngit checkout -b feature2release \ngit rebase release\n\n\nIn the above I create a master and two branches develop and release off of it. Afterwards I then proceed to create feature branches off develop and commit to them and merge them back into develop. Each feature simply adds a new java method to the code. Now I want to merge only the method introduced in feature 2 to release while ignoring any other commits made to develop (in this case just the method introduced by feature 1). Now to do this I create a feature2release branch and then rebase that with release. However when I do this I get the following message.\n\nCurrent branch feature2release is up to date.\n\n\nCan you tell me what I am doing wrong or how instead I should do it.&quot;, &#39;If I understand your question right I can suggest a solution. But before I say several words about my perception of your problem:\n\n\nYour develop branch is rather volatile, and your QA run tests on this branch\nYour release branch is rather stable, and you deploy it to your production contour\nYou need to create feature branches (i.e feature1, feature2, feature3) but merge it to develop branch for qa-tests\nYou need to include only some feature branches (not all merged to developed) into your next release\n\n\nIf it\&#39;s all true you can:\n\n\nCreate each feature branch (feature1, feature2, feature3) from stable release branch\nMerge each ready feature branch to develop for tests\nIf this feature branch fails all fixes should be done in its branch and not develop branch\nWhen feature is ready its branch also is ready for merging to release\nWhen the time of the next release, you choose only desired branches and merge it to release\n\n\nThere are some significant drawbacks in this approach but these disadvantages are related to functional intersection developed in different feature branches. Your qa-tests on develop branch is vulnerable to false positives and false negatives errors in finding bugs.\n\nI\&#39;ve added some explanation drawing:\n\n\nAnother workflow for edited part of question\n\n\nCreate each feature branch (feature1, feature2, feature3) from unstable develop branch with changes of other people\nMerge each ready feature branch to develop for tests\nIf this feature branch fails all fixes should be done in its branch and not develop branch\nWhen feature is ready its branch also is ready create branch feature1-for-release for merging to release with this steps\n\ngit branch feature1-for-release feature1 # create branch for release\ngit chekcout feature1-for-release # checkout to this branch\ngit rebase release # rebase from master\nWhen the time of the next release, you choose only desired branches (i.e feature1-for-release) and merge it to release\n\n\nThere are some significant drawbacks in this approach and firstly you never ever run tests on this particular rebased branches. And this is a problem. I can give a simple example:\n\n\nYou start your branch feature1 from develop with merged branch feature0 with some functionality\nYou use this functionality from feature0 and create some new feature\nYour feature1 has been passed qa-tests and you create feature1-for-release branch\nAssume that you decide to add to next release feature1-for-release branch but not feature0-for-release branch\nYour release will be deployed with non-working functionality from feature1 task because it depends on feature0 which is absent in this release\n\n\nUpdate for another workflow for edited part of question\n\nI follow steps of Edit update 2 and get the same results. \nTest.java in master has one line:\n\n// initial\n\n\nTest.java in feature1 has two lines:\n\n// initial\n// feature1\n\n\nTest.java in feature2 has 3 lines:\n\n// initial\n// feature1\n// feature2\n\n\nAnd it puts the end to the use of such a scheme. I think now I can explain why:\n\n\nrebase is a method to apply your difference on the top of the changes from another branch\nso there is no changes in release branch and you get feature2release is up to date\nit\&#39;s my fault, I rarely use complicated rebase (usually only for squash commits, and changes in message for commits) so I forgot about this in my logical construction for alternative scheme\n\n\nAlso I try to create feature2releaseV2 branch using combination of git apply + git diff in for of:\n\n\ncreate branch feature2releaseV2 from release\napply diff between start and finish of creating feature2\nbut I get this errors:\n\n# b1d49dd - end of feature2, #78d0839 - start of feature2\n$ git diff b1d49dd 78d0839 | git apply -v \nChecking patch src/Test.java...\nerror: while searching for:\n// initial\n// feature1\n// feature2\n\n\nAlso I try to create feature2releaseV3 branch using cherry-picking but get conflicts which are very hard to resolve:\n\n$ git status\nOn branch feature2releaseV2\nYou are currently cherry-picking commit b1d49dd.\n  (fix conflicts and run &quot;git cherry-pick --continue&quot;)\n  (use &quot;git cherry-pick --abort&quot; to cancel the cherry-pick operation)\n\nUnmerged paths:\n  (use &quot;git add &amp;lt;file&amp;gt;...&quot; to mark resolution)\n\n    both modified:   src/Test.java\n\n$ git diff\ndiff --cc src/Test.java\nindex 348ec50,9a56d40..0000000\n--- a/src/Test.java\n+++ b/src/Test.java\n@@@ -1,1 -1,3 +1,7 @@@\n- // initial\n++&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; HEAD\n++// initial\n++=======\n+ // initial\n+ // feature1\n -// feature2\n++// feature2\n++&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; b1d49dd... feature2\n\n\nAs a result, I have one piece of advice:\n\nIt\&#39;s necessarily to create releases more often and in this case every developer can start new feature branch from stable release version.

This was because we didn&#39;t have real CI implemented, not enough trust in our test suite, no established ways to validate if we broke something in prod, no metrics, no feature switches etc... not much encouragement to hit the deploy button.\nThen we improved the CI aspect big time, so we didn&#39;t fear deploying anymore. On its own this increased significantly the deployment and merging frequency.\nBut the review was still mandatory for any new change. It didn&#39;t really encourage small changes, so I made it optional. Then we had reviews only for risky changes or when the PR owner asked it.\nAfter the CI improvement this gave us a real good boost, we managed to have several merges and deploys / day with less defects.\nThe review is also easier for me if I can see the whole change in one place, like in a PR.&quot;]</td><td class="s6" dir="ltr">[&#39;Use short-lived branches&#39;, &#39;Use a single shared trunk&#39;, &#39;Promote frequent and rapid integration (CI) (+)&#39;, &#39;Adopt CI/CD pipelines for automated integration and delivery&#39;, &#39;Enable fast and continuous feedback (+)&#39;, &#39;Make small, frequent commits&#39;, &#39;Mandatory code review policy&#39;, &#39;Automate test execution (unit, integration, e2e)&#39;, &#39;Automated build and tests always pass on the CI&#39;]</td></tr><tr style="height: 30px"><th id="1569038740R168" style="height: 30px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 30px">169</div></th><td class="s7" dir="ltr">Subversion - Async development cycle... two trunks?</td><td class="s8" dir="ltr">472902</td><td class="s9" dir="ltr"><a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/472902/subversion-async-development-cycle-two-trunks">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/472902/subversion-async-development-cycle-two-trunks</a></td><td class="s10" dir="ltr">YANLIŞ</td><td class="s7" dir="ltr">[&#39;Subversion - Async development cycle... two trunks? (new)&#39;, &#39;Currently in our enterprise we have a situation that i think it\&#39;s not very common, or at least i haven\&#39;t found a similar case in Internet. My problem is that we have software that can evolve by more than one requirement, and both not necessarily will coincide in their release date.\n\nWe have a development cycle where all software is developed in a &quot;DEV&quot; environment, and then it\&#39;s handled to SQA so it can be tested on &quot;LAB&quot; environment; if all works OK then this software is moved to &quot;PROD&quot; environment. The problem i am facing here is that i cant use a single trunk and i don\&#39;t see how a single branch could work either.\n\nFor example, lets say i have requirements A and B, one to be released today and the other a week from today. Both have reached LAB environment but today\&#39;s release to PROD environment only has to contain A, since B is not yet needed by our business users (and it cannot be released early because it would introduce some error\&#39;s to others systems). Both requirements where developed in different branches (they respond to different needs). In this case my problem is that i can\&#39;t have a single trunk where developers can merge to see both changes in &quot;DEV&quot; environment, and then use the same trunk to feed &quot;LAB&quot; environment since it would have source code not yet scheduled for release.\n\nI think i should also mention that having a separate development environment for each branch is not possible because this software is based on PL/SQL (Oracle) and our current test database is about 350Mb in size, so having a different one for each requirement would be quite expensive and hard to manage.\n\nAny suggestion or similar experience would be appreciated.\n\nRegards (new)&#39;, &#39;I would suggest following:\n\n\nproduct-1/\n\n\ntrunk/\nbranches/\n\n\nfeature-branches/\n\n\nreq-A/\nreq-B/\n\npre-lab/\nlab/\nprod/\n\n\n\n\nDevelopers start developing for new requirements on the respective feature-branch.  Then you reintegrate the feature-branches which have been decided to be included for environment LAB/ to pre-lab/, where you can integrate the changes for new features and bugfixes from trunk/.\n\nAs soon as you know that works (will take some time, as any integration step merging from several sources), you merge all changes from pre-lab/ to lab/.  When you restrict yourself to merge only from pre-lab/ to lab/, this merge will always be clean, i.e. one mouse-click away.\n\nIn trunk/ you could merge all feature-branches and bug-fixes together, but depending on your project-structure and software-development-process this may need some further discussion.\n\nBe sure to use Subversion 1.5, as this merging will get you lost in hell with older versions. (new)&#39;, &quot;Based on your last paragraph you&#39;ve got quite a pickle.  I believe the best practice for this is to branch per feature and merge the features into the trunk as they&#39;re needed/released.  I don&#39;t really know if there&#39;s a second best practice for improving your situation (But I&#39;m not that smart)... (new)&quot;, &#39;It sounds to me like you could benefit from using a distributed VCS (git, mercurial, bazaar, etc.) (new)&#39;, &quot;In most cases what you need is to test the resultant application with features enabled AND disabled so that you can choose what to enable or disable at release time.\n\nThe point is that if you create a testing release that contains both and then go and completely remove one part, regardless of your versionning system, you could end up creating an integration problem, which you wont know about and you&#39;ll have already pushed it to the production server.\n\nRegardless of what you do, you still need to test the exact product you will give to the client.\n\nA release should then be what is going to be tested, not what is going to production. What will be going to production is the tested release. At that point it simply a question of creating a branch for each release or feature and merge what is needed.\n\nA merge operation doesn&#39;t need to be for everything. If the commits are well done, you should be able to merge just the features (comits and/or files) you need between branches easily.

However, trunk-based workflows have risen in popularity (whereby the promotion process simply involves tagging a release rather than trying to transplant cherry-picked commits onto a diverged history). How can release tagging workflows incorporate similar protections (i.e., multiple approvers and passing tests) while remaining more permissive for other untagged pushes/merges to that trunk branch?\nFor example, are such (collaborative tag-creation) controls already explicitly featured (in GitHub, BitBucket, or any equivalents), or can it be supported with only modest gymnastics (like enabling general tag protections plus implementing a manually-approved CI action to create a new tag), or would it require external tooling/interfaces run under privileged service accounts (tantamount to a bespoke code management platform)?&#39;, &quot;The conventional answer is probably to avoid this problem by spinning up (and down) separate test environments for every feature branch, rather than maintaining one perpetual staging environment. In a DevOps context it may take mature/sophisticated Infra-as-Code CI to achieve this and so, instead of strict GitOps, progressive delivery is not uncommonly managed by additional tools such as Flagger or ArgoCD.\nThere&#39;s no established concept of a &amp;quot;Release/Tag Request&amp;quot;. Platforms currently seem not to facilitate collaborative release-tagging workflows anywhere near as rigorous as pull requests. A few platforms seem to facilitate restricting tagging to certain principals (sometimes by treating refs/tags/** as though it were a branch), and some seem to permit manual gatekeeping of some CI processes (which might then be delegated to carefully orchestrate releases), but support is generally limited.\nMost platforms do support different protection levels for different branches, and PRs between arbitrary branches, so the obvious way to manage separate staging vs production environments under GitOps is still to maintain a stable (or release) branch, and for the promotion workflow to be a PR that merges the main (or develop) branch into stable. The main pitfalls of this gitflow are unintended drift between environments and difficult merges. To avoid drift it is important that any intended persistent differences between environments are represented using separate subdirs and that differences between branches are never allowed to persist after merges. In practice it may warrant a CI script to propose release PRs in a way that ensures those branches end up fully synced.

(new)&#39;, &quot;I don&#39;t use Mercurial, but i&#39;d like to start, so i&#39;m reading about it. The only SCM system i&#39;ve used extensively is CVS. Most of what i&#39;ve read about Mercurial makes sense, and sounds good. But i&#39;m alternately shocked and perplexed by that way it does tags.\n\nA tag is just a nickname for a changeset (and by &#39;changeset&#39; we really mean the state resulting from the changeset). Cool. The mapping from tags to changeset IDs is stored in the .hgtags file. Also cool. The .hgtags file is versioned.\n\nWhat?\n\nThis has lots of counterintuitive consequences. For instance, if i commit a changeset which i then want to tag (say, the code which will form release 1.0), i have to commit again after tagging, to put the updated tag file into the repository. And if i then update to that tagged changeset at some later date, the working copy won&#39;t contain any knowledge of that tag. If i do some work, thus founding a new branch (say, for bugfixes, heading towards 1.1), that branch won&#39;t have any knowledge of the tag from which it grew. Unless i copy it over manually, that is.\n\nAnd as development continues both on the original trunk and my new branch, with tags being created to mark important changesets (the 2.0 release on the trunk, the 1.1 and 1.2 bugfix releases on the branch), both branches will proceed in ignorance of the other branch&#39;s tags. So, if i finish working on one branch, and want to switch to some particular changeset on another (say, i finish the 1.2 bugfix release, but now have to start on the 2.1 bugfix, based on 2.0), i am now stuffed. My current changeset doesn&#39;t know about 2.0!\n\nWhat can i do?\n\n\nI can ask someone who&#39;s working on the 2.x branch to read out the actual changeset ID for 2.0, and use that explicitly, but this is appalling.\nI could name my branches, as well as using tags, so that i could hop across to the head of the 2.x branch, thus learning about the new tags, and then skip back to the 2.0 tag. Assuming that branches, unlike tags, are universally visible - is that the case? Even if it is, this seems clunky.\nI could maintain a single global hgtags file outside the repository, and use a couple of hooks to pull in a copy on an update, overwriting the local copy, and to copy back any changes on a commit. I&#39;m not sure how this would work in a multi-user environment, where developers are pushing changes to a shared repository; i might need a separate repository just for the hgtags file.\nI could use local tags, which stand outside the versioning mechanism, and so avoid the whole problem. As with shared global tags, i would have to put in place a mechanism to synchronise the localtags file between developers.\n\n\nNone of these solutions seem totally great. What should i do?\n\nAn assumption here is that i&#39;m managing branches using named branches in a single repository, rather than repository-per-branch. Would the situation be any better if i did the latter? (new)&quot;, &#39;Versioning the .hgtags file allows you to\n\n\nedit tags and see who edited them (and why if they left a proper commit message)\ntransfer tags between repositories using the normal mechanisms\n\n\nHowever, there are some confusion going on here.\n\n\nYou write that\n\n\n  [...] And if i then update to that tagged changeset at some later date, the working copy won\&#39;t contain any knowledge of that tag. [...]\n\n\nThat is wrong, tags are collected from the .hgtags files found in all heads. That means that you can update to an old tag (hg update 0.1) and still see all your tags (hg tags).\nYou ask if branches are universally visible. Yes they are -- the names of named branches can be used in any context where you need to specify a changeset, as can tags.\n\n\nMake sure you understand what named branches are before you begin using them. They are actually not necessary for making a bugfix branch. You can instead choose to simply go back (hg update 1.0) and fix the bug and then commit. That will create a new head, which your line of development towards 1.1 (this gives you multiple heads). So you don\&#39;t have to create a named branch to add a new branch of development to your repository.\n\nHaving multiple heads is completely equivalent to having multiple clones. You can even convert back and forth: you can use\n\n% hg clone -r X-head repo repo-X\n\n\nto untangle the X-head changeset and its ancestors from the other changesets in repo. And you can combine multiple clones by simply pulling all changesets into one big clone.\n\nNamed branches are similar, yet different. They allow you to embed a named in each changeset. So you can have several changesets in your history with the name &quot;foo&quot;. When you do hg update foo you will end up at the tip-most of these changesets. In this way, named branches function as a kind of floating tag.\n\nIf you are uncomfortable with the idea of a permanent label for your changesets, you can instead try the bookmarks extension. That will also give you &quot;floating tags&quot; which you can use for updating, but they wont be permanently part of the history since they aren\&#39;t versioned.\n\nI hope this helps a bit. (new)&#39;, &quot;The choice of method for tagging definitely has some odd side effects, but they&#39;re explained well in this wiki. It&#39;s also suggested that you clone an entire repo and then update to the point of interest to avoid the case where you will have created a repo that does not contain the tag that was used to create it.

And I&#39;m moving to Git, which before a few days ago I&#39;ve never used.  (Git over SSH to a &amp;quot;public&amp;quot; repo)\nI&#39;m not asking about how to use Git, but rather how to structure the repository, or if I need multiple ones or what.   I have multiple projects that refer to multiple libraries.  I want to version label the libraries such that I can have something like this easily maintained:\nProject A, Shipped in 2012\nMain Project Source,  Version 1.0, Current Development version\nLib-A, Version 1.0\nLib-B, Version 2.0\nLib-C, Current Development Version\nProject B, To be shipped soon, update to 1.0\nMain Project Source,  Version 2.0, Current Development version\nLib-A, Version 2.0, Current Development Version\nLib-B, Version 1.0\nLib-C, Current Development Version\nThe idea being that I can pull down into a directory everything I need to build Project A and B - with whatever requirements they may have had back then - with the ability to use the current development version, OR stay with the older version (example: Lib-B in project B is an older version and is not being updated at this time, or if it is it would be a branch.)\nOriginally, I was thinking of something along the lines of (In Repo):\n/Src/Project A\n/Src/Project B\n/Src/Lib/LibA\n/Src/Lib/LibB\n/Src/Lib/LibC\nIn which case, I&#39;d have to bring them down into a different structure than exists in the archive, or at least, bring them down into different directories, either:\n/Src/ProjectA/Project A\n/Src/ProjectA/LibA\n/Src/ProjectA/LibB\n/Src/ProjectA/LibC\n\n/Src/ProjectB/Project B\n/Src/ProjectB/LibA\n/Src/ProjectB/LibB\n/Src/ProjectB/LibC\n\nor\n/Src/ProjectA\n/Src/ProjectB\n\n/Src/Lib/LibA\n/Src/Lib/LibB\n/Src/Lib/LibC\n(Sorry for the bad formatting, I tried really hard to convince this it wasn&#39;t code)\nBut with this structure, you would need to switch the Lib directories when you switched from project A to B&#39;s development... Not something I want to do.\nIt seems to me in order to do this in GIT I would want multiple Git repo&#39;s, maybe one for each Lib\nI&#39;ve been recently told the first option, bringing multiple versions down into different locations, would be a bad idea. (He was talking about under SVN, so may not apply),  The company I worked for did this kind of thing under Source Safe years ago and it worked pretty well - we were able to create a file that specified the version label of each lib to bring down and used a NANT script to fetch the correct versions, and could update them as required.  (Not sure what the easiest way to do that here is, initially, it would be something much simpler. like just a file that said what versions it needed or something)  One other thing that could be done is to apply a label across all Project A&#39;s source for a release something like:  &amp;quot;RELEASE_1_0_PROJECT_A&amp;quot; and have all source brought down based on that version label.  (Tag or whatever you wish to call it)\nWith Source Safe though, the labels are only across that location and below, not across the whole repo.\nI&#39;ve also worked places where they would branch the code and create a new top level tree, such as:\n/Dev/x64 Branch/ProjectA  (With the rest of the structure the same as the 2nd example.\nAnd\n/Dev/trunk/ProjectA    (With the rest of the structure the same as the 2nd example.)\nIn which case, to work on A and B at the same time you would have two branches of everything you needed for that project, a Project A Branch, and a Project B branch.\nSuggestions?\nThanks\nUpdate:  (Would have done this as a comment below, but StackOverflow overflowed and wouldn&#39;t let me post comments that long)\nOK, I did that and ended up with:\n Project\\\n     Libs\\\n        LibA\n        LibB\n\nI created it with:\ngit add submodule ../Lib/LibA ./Libs/LibA\ngit update --init\n\nModified a file, and then tried to push it:\n\ngit push\nwarning: push.default is unset; its implicit value is changing in\nGit 2.0 from &#39;matching&#39; to &#39;simple&#39;.

What is the Simple/matching thing?  Which do I use (it looks like it gives me the command to make it the default.)\nThanks. (new)&quot;, &quot;It sounds like you want to use submodules.\n\nYou&#39;d have five repositories:\n\n\nProject A\nProject B\nLib A\nLib B\nLib C\n\n\nProject A would have three submodules, one for each library.  Project B would also have three submodules, one for each library.\n\nWhen you clone a project, you&#39;ll make sure to use --recursive and you&#39;ll get all of the library sources checked out too, at the right versions (different versions for different projects, if you want).  When you update library code, you&#39;ll want to commit changes into project code so the projects will use the new version of the libraries.\n\nSubmodules work by storing a reference to the SHA-1 of the submodule version in the parent project.  So version 1.0 of Project A will reference commit abc123... of Lib A, which corresponds to version 1.0 of Lib A.  When you check out Project A you automatically get version 1.0 of Lib A. (new)&quot;, &#39;Please take the time to get your hands dirty with git, and study e.g. Scott Chacon\&#39;s &quot;Pro git&quot;, Ben Lynn\&#39;s &quot;git magic&quot; and have the various tutorials/cheat sheets linked at git\&#39;s homepage nearby. Depending on the extent of the development group(s), you should also read up on git workflows. Finding out early what git can and can\&#39;t do, where it differs from the systems you know (and there are differences), what things that used to be just pipe dreams or impossibly complicated are trivial in git; before commiting on how to organize the data and workflow can save many frustrations later on.\n\nJust as I was told when studying English: Don\&#39;t translate, learn to think in English.

In this model, your critical hotfix is made in a branch off the released version, merged back into the release branch, then merged into your development branch.\n\nIf you find that the codebase has changed so much that merging doesn&#39;t make sense, then you&#39;d need to fix the bug separately in both branches.

Now, because of my familiarity with Blackberry, I chose to begin implementing the first of these three applications, Orange, on the Blackberry platform.  I found a way to integrate a number of Blackberry platforms (since they use relatively the same API among different BB operating systems, with some exceptions) into the same codebase.  Currently, my codebase looks something like this:\n\nOrange/\n  trunk/\n   src/\n     ... orange&#39;s source tree...\n  branches/\n    1.0/\n     ... orange&#39;s source tree as it looked at release 1.0 ...\n  tags/\n     1.0.0/\n     1.1.0/\n\n\nSo, basically, I&#39;m using a version-based methodology to my branching.  Now, however, we want to migrate this application to the Android platform (and, at some point in time, probably to other mobile or even desktop platforms).  So, my question is, what is the best method for branching with a single application across multiple platforms?  I have read Branching Strategies, as well as a number of branching strategy webpages (e.g. http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/10/software-branching-and-parallel-universes.html ), but I&#39;m still unconvinced at branching based on having a &#39;common&#39; trunk (e.g. as described in the last link as &#39;Branch per Technology&#39;).  \n\nThe reason I remain unconvinced is that I&#39;m a believer in the version-based branching strategy.  It seems logical; if you want to maintain separate stages of development, then branches seem like the ideal way to do this.  If I have aspects of the code that are &#39;common&#39; between all three platforms, then I decide to make an android release, do I branch all of the code from the common and android trunks to make a new release tag?  Or, do I keep all of the code in the &#39;common&#39; branch in the android and blackberry branches as well?\n\nI thought that perhaps another thing I could do would be to create separate projects, for instance orange-blackberry and orange-android.  This might clutter my svn repository, however, since we keep all of our projects in the same repository.  So, inevitably, I will have orange-blackberry, orange-android, cherry-android, cherry-blackberry, pear-android, pear-blackberry, along with a series of project folders for any other application I create.\n\nSo, I&#39;m looking for some feedback about what might be the best way to manage all of this chaos.  Also, if you could throw in some ideas about the logistics of transferring from my current implementation to the newer one, (i.e. what svn commands I should use to maintain history), that would be very much appreciated. (new)&quot;, &quot;BlackBerry Java code is j2me, so source code must be Java 1.3 compliant.  Android can use Java features all the way up to Java 6.   If you want your app to look decent, you will be using the RIM proprietary UI components (net.rim.device.*) and those won&#39;t be available on Android.\n\nI wouldn&#39;t consider an Android version of an application to be a branch of BlackBerry.  You should just start from scratch.   The platforms will share very little code, and the code that can be shared would be best factored into a library jar that both project incorporate.

Let’s say the latest released version is 4.1 but I’m also supporting versions 4.0, 3.5, and 3.6, so there is a maintenance branch for each of these. Trunk is used for features that won’t be released until 4.2. Now say a customer needs a bug fix to version 3.6. I’ll make the fix into my 3.6 maintenance branch and make a new maintenance release (for the sake of argument, 3.6.22).\n\nAt this point the fix is merged downwards into 4.0 and from there to 4.1, 4.2, and trunk, and from there, into any development branches made from trunk. Note that this is not a cherry-pick merge; it’s a normal SVN automatic merge.\n\nIf the fix is non-trivial we might make a dev branch from the 3.6 release branch and then reintegrate it in the normal way before releasing. Similarly, If the merge-down to 4.1 is non-trivial, we might make a development branch from 4.1 to merge into and then reintegrate it back up into 4.1 release when we’re happy with the merge.\n\nWhen we release version 4.2 we will branch off a maintenance branch for that in the same way, and trunk will become ongoing 4.3 work\n\nShould I (or even can I) use exactly the same workflow in git, or is this “old-hat” traditional svn thinking which needs to be reconsidered? (new)&#39;, &#39;Branching strategies do not really change much depending on the version control technology.  What you described sounds like pretty standard branching workflow for a live product.  What would change in moving to Git from another tool like SVN is the cost of creating and maintaining a branch.  In Git, branching is extremely cheap.  A branch in Git is basically just a pointer to a commit.  So the cost, for example, of creating a maintenance branch containing only a few commits would be incrementally very small.  This might not be the case with a tool like SVN, where a copy or every file in the project might need to be created.

(new)&#39;, &quot;We operate Trunk Based Development.  Our latest and greatest code is continuously integrated into our trunk, until we are ready to get it UAT&#39;d.  At that stage we create a release candidate branch from the trunk for UAT, and new development continues in the trunk.  Once this release candidate has passed UAT it will be tagged and released to Live, and a maintenance branch created from the tag which will live until the next major (UAT&#39;d) release.\n\nThe question is, how to handle the merging of bug fixes.  If a bug is fixed on the Maintenance Branch during UAT, this code fix should be merged to the trunk and to the release candidate.  If a UAT bug is fixed during UAT, this code fix should be merged to trunk.\n\nWe all know this, but sometimes merges get missed, and we&#39;ve had cases where bugs that were fixed in Live have re-surfaced again as the fixes weren&#39;t applied to all the required branches (trunk and release candidate).\n\nWe have started referencing the commits to other branches now in our commit comments (essentially our own poor mans merge info) in order to track this.\n\nHowever is there any way for us to be absolutely sure that all commits to the maintenance branch get merged to trunk and release candidate, and that all commits to the release candidate get merged to trunk?&quot;, &quot;Since there is no way for the VCS to spot the difference between bug fix and ongoing development the short answer is there is no way to be 100% sure,  a good tracking system that has a check list for the developers may help but even threatening to fire or shoot offenders does not ensure it doesn&#39;t happen.

Personally I lean towards merging since this preserves a visual illustration of on which base a task was started and finished, and I even prefer merge --no-ff for this purpose. It has other drawbacks however. Also many haven\&#39;t realized the useful property of merging - that it isn\&#39;t commutative (merging a topic branch into master does not mean merging master into the topic branch).\nI am looking for a natural workflow \n\nSometimes mistakes happen because our procedures don\&#39;t capture a specific situation with simple rules. For example a fix needed for earlier releases should of course be based sufficiently downstream to be possible to merge upstream into all branches necessary (is the usage of these terms clear enough?). However it happens that a fix makes it into the master before the developer realizes it should have been placed further downstream, and if that is already pushed (even worse, merged or something based on it) then the option remaining is cherry-picking, with its associated perils. What simple rules like such do you use? Also in this is included the awkwardness of one topic branch necessarily excluding other topic branches (assuming they are branched from a common baseline). Developers don\&#39;t want to finish a feature to start another one feeling like the code they just wrote is not there anymore\nHow to avoid creating merge conflicts (due to cherry-pick)? \n\nWhat seems like a sure way to create a merge conflict is to cherry-pick between branches, they can never be merged again? Would applying the same commit in revert (how to do this?) in either branch possibly solve this situation? This is one reason I do not dare to push for a largely merge-based workflow.\nHow to decompose into topical branches? \n\nWe realize that it would be awesome to assemble a finished integration from topic branches, but often work by our developers is not clearly defined (sometimes as simple as &quot;poking around&quot;) and if some code has already gone into a &quot;misc&quot; topic, it can not be taken out of there again, according to the question above?

(new)&#39;, &#39;The most troubling feature new developers to DVCS need to realize is about the publication process:\n\n\nyou can import (fetch/pull) whatever remote repo you need\nyou can publish (push) to any (bare) repo you want\n\n\nFrom that, you can respect a few rules to make your questions easier:\n\n\nonly rebase a branch if it hasn\&#39;t been pushed (not pushed since the last rebase)\nonly push to a bare repo (mandatory since Git1.7)\nfollow Linus\&#39;s advices on rebase and merges\n\n\nNow:\n\nWorkflows / branching models: \n\neach workflow is there to support a release management process, and that is tailored for each project.\nWhat I can add to the workflow you mention is: each developer should not create a feature branch, only a &quot;current dev&quot; branch, because the truth is: the developer often doesn\&#39;t know what exactly his/her branch will produce: one feature, several (because it ended up being too complex a feature), none (because not ready in time for release), another feature (because the original one had &quot;morphed&quot;),...\n\nOnly an &quot;integrator&quot; should established official feature branches on a &quot;central&quot; repo, which can then be fetched by developers to rebase/merge the part of their work that fits that feature.\n\nMerging vs rebasing (tangled vs sequential history): \n\nI like my answer you mention (&quot;Workflow description for git usage for in-house development&quot;)\n\nI am looking for a natural workflow: \n\nfor fixes, it can help associating each fix with a ticket from a bug tracking, which helps the developer remember where (i.e. on which branch, i.e. a dedicated branch &quot;for fixes&quot;) he/she should commit such modifications.\nThen hooks can help protect a central repo against pushes from non-validated bug-fixes or from branches from which one shouldn\&#39;t push. (no specific solution here, all this need to be adapted to your environment)\n\nHow to avoid creating merge conflicts (due to cherry-pick)?\n\nAs stated by Jakub Narębski in his answer, cherry-picking should be reserved for rare situations where it is required.\nIf your setup involves a lot of cherry-picking (i.e. &quot;it is not rare&quot;), then something is off.\n\n\n  Would applying the same commit in revert (how to do this?) \n\n\ngit revert should take care of that, but that is not ideal.\n\n\n  How to decompose into topical branches?\n\n\nAs long as a branch as not yet been pushed everywhere, a developer should reorganize its history of commits (once he/she finally see the development takes a more definitive and stable shape) into:\n\n\nseveral branches if needed (one by clear identified feature)\na coherent set of commits within one branch (see Trimming Git Checkins)\n\n\nProper procedures like code review and graduating ?\n\nIntegration branches (in a dedicated integration) repo can help the developer to:\n\n\nrebase his/her development on top of that remote integration branch (pull --rebase)\nsolve locally\npush the development to that repo\ncheck with the integrator that doesn\&#39;t result in a mess ;) (new)&#39;, &#39;I think, and I might be wrong, that one of the things that\&#39;s most misunderstood about git is its distributed nature. This makes it very different to say subversion in the ways you can work although you can mimick SVN behaviour should you want. The problem is pretty much any workflow will do, which is great but also misleading.\n\nIf I have my understanding of kernel development (I\&#39;ll focus on that) right, everyone has their own git repository for developing the kernel. There is one repository, linux-2.6.git, looked after by Torvalds, that acts as the release repository. People clone from here if they wish to start developing a feature against the &quot;release&quot; branch.\n\nOther repositories do some development. The idea is to clone from linux-2.6, branch out as many times as you like until such a point as you\&#39;ve got a working &quot;new&quot; feature. Then, when this is ready, you may make it available to someone considered trusted, who will pull this branch from your repository into theirs and merge it into the mainstream. In the linux kernel this happens on several levels (trusted lieutenants) until it reaches linux-2.6.git at which point it becomes &quot;the kernel&quot;.\n\nNow here\&#39;s where it gets confusing. Branch names don\&#39;t need to be consistent across repositories at all. So I can git pull origin master:vanilla-code and get a branch from the origin\&#39;s master in a branch in my repository called vanilla-code. Providing I know what\&#39;s going on, it really doesn\&#39;t matter - it is distributed in the sense that all repositories are peers to each other and not just shared across several computers like SVN.\n\nSo, with all of this in mind:\n\n\nI think it is up to each programmer how they do their branching. All you need is a central repository for managing releases etc. Trunk could be head. Releases could be tags or branches and hotfixes are probably branches in themselves. In fact, I\&#39;d probably do releases as branches so you can keep patching them.\nI would merge and not rebase. If for example you take a repository, clone it, branch and do some dev, then pull from your origin you should, in your repository, probably make another branch and merge the latest master into yourbranch so that someone else can pull your changes with as little effort as possible. There is very rarely a need to truly rebase, in my experience.\nI think it\&#39;s a case of understanding the way Git works and what it can do. It does take a while and a lot of good communication - I only truly started to understand what\&#39;s going on when I began using git with other developers and even now, some things I\&#39;m not sure about.\nMerge conflicts are useful. I know, I know, you want it all to work, but, the fact is code changes and you do need to merge the results into something that works. Merge conflicts are in fact just more programming. I\&#39;ve never found an easy explanation for what to do about them, so here it is: note the files that have merge conflicts, go and change them to what they should be, git add . and then git commit.\nHowever it suits. As I\&#39;ve said, each users git repository is their own to play with and branch names don\&#39;t need to be the same. If you had a staging repository, for example, you could enforce a naming schema, but you don\&#39;t need to for each developer, only in the release repo.\nThis is the merge stage. You only merge into release branches etc when you consider code to be reviewed/pass quality testing.\n\n\nI hope that helps. I realise VonC as just posted a very similar explanation... I can\&#39;t type fast enough!\n\nEdit some further thoughts on how to use git in a commercial setting, as this seems relevant to the OP from the comments: \n\n\nThe release repository, we\&#39;ll call it product.git, is accessible by a number of senior programmers / technical people responsible for actually looking after the product itself. They are analogous to the role of maintainers in OSS.\nThese programmers probably also in part lead development of new versions, so they might also code themselves and maintain varios repositories. They might manage staging repositories for really new features and they might also have their own repositories. \nBelow them are programmers responsible for developing individual bits. For example, someone might be responsible for the UI work. They therefore manage the UI.git repository.\nBelow them are the actual programmers who develop the features as their full day to day job.\n\n\nSo what happens? Well, everyone pulls at the start of each day from the &quot;upstream&quot; source i.e. the release repository (which will also probably contain the latest material from the previous days development). Everyone does this, directly. This will go on a branch in their repository, probably called &quot;master&quot; or maybe if you\&#39;re me called &quot;latest&quot;. The programmer will then do some work. This work might be something they\&#39;re not sure about, so they make a branch, do the work. If it doesn\&#39;t work, they can delete the branch and go back. If it does, they will have to merge into the main branch they\&#39;re currently working on. We\&#39;ll say this is a UI programmer working on latest-ui so he does git checkout latest-ui followed by git merge abc-ui-mywhizzynewfeature. He then tells his technical lead (the UI lead) hey, I\&#39;ve completed such a task, pull from me. So the UI lead does git pull user-repo lastest-ui:lastest-ui-suchafeature-abc. The UI lead then looks at it on that branch and says, actually, that\&#39;s very good, I\&#39;ll merge it into ui-latest. He might then tell everyone below him to pull from him on their ui-latest branches or whatever name they\&#39;ve given them, and so the feature gets explored by the devs. If the team is happy, the UI lead might ask the testing lead to pull from him and merge the changes. This propagates out to everyone (downstream of the change) who tests it and submits bug reports etc. Finally, if the feature passes testing etc, one of the top technical leads might merge it into the current working copy of the program, at which point all the changes are then propagated back down. And so on.\n\nIt\&#39;s not a &quot;traditional&quot; way of working and is designed to be &quot;peer driven&quot; rather than &quot;hierarchical&quot; like SVN/CVS. In essence, everyone has commit access, but only locally. It is access to the repository and which repository you designate as the release repo that allows you to use hierarchy. (new)&#39;, &#39;A model that I\&#39;ve used with good results is the following:\n\nA &quot;blessed&quot; repo everybody pushes and pulls to/from, basically a client-server topology.\n\nThere\&#39;s no master branch so no developer can push any code into &quot;mainline&quot;.\n\nAll developments happen on topic branches. We namespaced names to easily detect who is responsible for it: jn/newFeature or jn/issue-1234\n\nThere is also a near 1-to-1 mapping between branches and kanban/scrum cards on the whiteboard.\n\nTo release a branch it is pushed to the blessed repo and the kanban-card is moved to ready for review.\n\nThen, if the branch is accepted by the review, it is a candidate for a release.\n\nA release happens when a set of accepted branches are merged together and tagged with a version number.\n\nBy pushing the new tag to the blessed repo there is a new possible base for new features.\n\nTo avoid merge conflicts developers are kindly requested to update (merge) their unreleased branches to the latest release tag. (new)&#39;, &#39;Personally, I try and keep only release-ready code in the master branch.\n\nWhen I work on a new feature or bugfix I do that in a branch. I also unit-test in the branch.

(new)&#39;, &#39;So it looks like my main branch (origin-repo) is a feature branch of the actual feature branch\n\n\nGiven a commit structure like\n\n  B &amp;lt;--(branch1)\n /\nA\n \\\n  C &amp;lt;--(branch2)\n\n\nthere is no special relationship between A and either one of these branches over the other.  Maybe branch1 happens to be called master.  Maybe branch2 is called feature.  Maybe master existed at A before feature was created, but if so git doesn\&#39;t remember or care about that detail.\n\nPoint being, &quot;feature branch&quot; is a descriptive label useful to people as they understand a branching model.  It is not a &quot;physically real&quot; concept in git.  Both branches are branches, and that is all.\n\n\n  and the feature branch goes all the way back to the tag.\n\n\nBranches don\&#39;t &quot;go back&quot; at all.  A branch is a pointer to a commit.  You might think of that commit as the &quot;tip of the branch&quot; or something like that, but in fact that\&#39;s all the branch is.  There is no path through history that\&#39;s &quot;also part of the branch&quot;.  There can be one or more paths through history that are reachable from the branch, but those same paths may be reachable from another branch, and there is no special relationship between the path(s) and any one branch over another.\n\nSo what you\&#39;re really getting at is that your visualization tool, in trying to cater to the abstractions we like to impose over branches - such as a relationship between a path of commits and a branch - &quot;guessed wrong&quot; about which branch you\&#39;d like to see associated with which path through history.\n\nI can\&#39;t tell you why it &quot;guessed wrong&quot;.  I can tell you it had to guess, because the relationship you wanted to see isn\&#39;t a real thing.
